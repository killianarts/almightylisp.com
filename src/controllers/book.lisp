        "Common Lisp is an old programming language that hasn't changed since it was standardized. That means that any learning material produced for the language is still useful even today. You can read Touretzky, Norvig, etc. and learn from people far smarter than me.")
      (p :class "almighty-book-paragraph"
        "However, the methods of teaching material, the culture of the people reading the material, and the problems or projects presented in the material may not be as relevant to modern audiences. Touretzky writes for new programmers and doesn't even teach Lisp's OOP facilities; Norvig teaches first principles of programming geared toward old fashioned AI; SICP is heavy on math and wasn't written in an age of ubiquitous ecosystems like JavaScript or Python; Steele wrote a language reference, not a tutorial; various other authors focus on macros, CLOS, etc. These older teaching materials are still irreplaceable masterpieces (Norvig perhaps the best of them), but a modern audience has modern needs and sensibilities.")
      (p :class "almighty-book-paragraph"
        "Practical Common Lisp at one time was the book for modern audiences, but even when it was released it fell short of what it should have been. It provides lots of practical projects, but doesn't provide a detailed guide for how to present those projects to the world. It's a book written for experienced programmers who are Lisp-curious and is partially meant to advocate for Lisp, but does little to fix the problem of Lisp's steep learning curve.")
      (p :class "almighty-book-paragraph"
        "And it does have a steep learning curve. Why? Not really because of any feature of Common Lisp. The parentheses can be a bit challenging at first, but it's more of an emotional challenge than a technical one. Macros are tough to master, but not so hard to get started with. Common Lisp is a big language, but beginning is not particularly hard and searching the HyperSpec can go a long way to deepen your knowledge of the language.")
      (p :class "almighty-book-paragraph"
        "No, it's not the language that's the source of the learning curve--it's Emacs. Emacs is the defacto-standard text editor for Common Lisp development. It's also 50 years old and doesn't have the mainstream popularity of other editors, creating a considerable mental block to even considering learning it or Common Lisp. On top of that, developers interact with Emacs very differently from how they interact with VSCode or the JetBrains IDEs (let alone OpenCode or Claude Code-like agentic LLM CLIs), hindering new users from transferring knowledge from the development environments they are familiar with.")
      (p :class "almighty-book-paragraph"

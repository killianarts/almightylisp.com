<h2 id="why-i-wrote-this-book" class="almighty-section-title">WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Common Lisp is an old programming language that hasn't changed since it was standardized. That means that any learning material produced for the language is still useful even today. You can read Touretzky, Norvig, etc. and learn from people far smarter than me.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, the methods of teaching material, the culture of the people reading the material, and the problems or projects presented in the material may not be as relevant to modern audiences. Touretzky writes for new programmers and doesn't even teach Lisp's OOP facilities; Norvig teaches first principles of programming geared toward old fashioned AI; SICP is heavy on math and wasn't written in an age of ubiquitous ecosystems like JavaScript or Python; Steele wrote a language reference, not a tutorial; various other authors focus on macros, CLOS, etc. These older teaching materials are still irreplaceable masterpieces (Norvig perhaps the best of them), but a modern audience has modern needs and sensibilities.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Practical Common Lisp at one time was the book for modern audiences, but even when it was released it fell short of what it should have been. It provides lots of practical projects, but doesn't provide a detailed guide for how to present those projects to the world. It's a book written for experienced programmers who are Lisp-curious and is partially meant to advocate for Lisp, but does little to fix the problem of Lisp's steep learning curve.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And it does have a steep learning curve. Why? Not really because of any feature of Common Lisp. The parentheses can be a bit challenging at first, but it's more of an emotional challenge than a technical one. Macros are tough to master, but not so hard to get started with. Common Lisp is a big language, but beginning is not particularly hard and searching the HyperSpec can go a long way to deepen your knowledge of the language.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">No, it's not the language that's the source of the learning curve--it's Emacs. Emacs is the defacto-standard text editor for Common Lisp development. It's also 50 years old and doesn't have the mainstream popularity of other editors, creating a considerable mental block to even considering learning it or Common Lisp. On top of that, developers interact with Emacs very differently from how they interact with VSCode or the JetBrains IDEs (let alone OpenCode or Claude Code-like agentic LLM CLIs), hindering new users from transferring knowledge from the development environments they are familiar with.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Emacs is the elephant in the room that no books on Common Lisp address. PCL made a half-hearted attempt with Lisp in a Box (a distribution of Emacs somewhat analogous to the later Portacle, now deprecated), but it was insufficient to the task.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">With this book I hope to provide you--the experienced Lisp-curious developer--with a source for learning both Common Lisp and Emacs at the same time, help you get oriented to the Lisp ecosystem and current practices, and get you deploying your applications in your preferred medium by the time you're finished reading.</p>

<h2 id="almighty" class="almighty-section-title">ALMIGHTY</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you are given the job of choosing the tech stack for a job, how do you choose? If the task is data science, what language would you choose? Would your choice be different if your task was web development? Would it be different if it was embedded development? Or accounting? Or mobile apps?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Programming is fraught with choices. Probably the most important choice is which language to use for any particular task. If you're doing data analytics, you need to use Python. If you're developing a web application, you need to use JavaScript or Ruby. If you're writing accounting software, you need to use Java. If you're writing real-time software with performance and size limitations, you use C or Rust.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We take it for granted that such choices are necessary, that we need to choose a language based on a task. No language is adapted to every task; when you need to drill, you don't use a hammer.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But what if we had a special, universal tool? What if the tool could be<i>adapted</i> to the task, rather than<i>chosen</i> for it?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Common Lisp is just such a language. It's the highest level language out there thanks to macros and the parentheses, but a surprisingly low level language thanks to the ability to inspect generated assembly output and the ability to specify types (although in a somewhat sloppy way) to optimize for speed and memory efficiency. As a result, Lisp is both highly expressive while sacrificing little performance. The result is a highly adaptable language--perhaps the<i>most</i> adaptable.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Lisp does sacrifice<i>something</i>, though. Well-optimized C is going to yield smaller executables, lower memory use, and faster performance. Well written Ruby or Python is probably aesthetically more pleasing than well written Lisp--and I believe that aesthetics are important. The Lisp ecosystem can usually get you started, but it's not going to do most of the heavy lifting like in Java or JavaScript's ecosystems.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">With Lisp, you sacrifice choosing the absolute optimal tool for the job in exchange for absolute<i>flexibility</i>. Lisp may not initially be the best tool for any single job, but you can<i>mould</i> it into the best tool for many jobs. It's not the fastest, but it's competitive with the fastest. It's not the prettiest, but you can make it prettier if that's important to you. There may not be a free library available to do exactly what you want, but you usually don't have to start from scratch, either.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Lisp is not a language specialized to a domain of work; it's a language specialized to being<i>generally adaptable</i>. It's not a master of any domain, but it can be adapted to a wide variety of domains.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In English, a man who isn't a specialist in any field, but who commands a holistic knowledge and capabilities in many domains, is called a<i>generalist</i>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In Japanese, such a man is called オールマイティ--almighty.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">That's what Lisp is. Lisp is almighty, and it summons programmers to become almighty.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And in the current environment, you have no choice. AI is here. Whether we like it or not, many people will gladly trade their birthright for a bowl of stew; their ability to do things themselves now and in the future for their ability to do a lot of things (badly)<i>now</i>; craftmanship for crude replacements; their fellow humans and society as a whole for the chance at "generational wealth".</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Lines are being drawn. Either you join them on their quest or they will seek to crush you.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You and I, friend, must become almighty.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="purpose" class="almighty-section-title">PURPOSE</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Learning Common Lisp is complicated by the fact that Emacs is the defacto standard Common Lisp code editor. Emacs is good, but making use of its capabilities requires adopting a different mental model for code editing, making it difficult and confusing to learn. Finding out that you need to learn an<i>old</i>,<i>weird</i> editor before you can even begin learning Common Lisp in ernest is enough to turn newcomers off.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This chapter is a quick references for getting started with Emacs and Common Lisp coding. It's intended to help bootstrap an understanding of Emacs concepts, Common Lisp concepts, and an understanding of common actions in both. You should experience a smooth transition to learning Common Lisp after completing this chapter.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">My intention is to make you less confused. If you are confused after reading this chapter, ask me for help on X (<a href="https://x.com/almighty_lisp">@almighty<sub>lisp</sub></a>). Consider me your Emacs and Common Lisp tech support.</p>

<h2 id="survival-emacs" class="almighty-section-title">SURVIVAL EMACS</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you first begin with this book, I assume you at least don't know Emacs keybindings. If you know Vim/Neovim style bindings, then you'll know how to do basic text navigation and editing, search and replace, etc. I'll teach you the basics of how to get around and get started following along with the next Lisp chapter. Importantly, you won't need to learn any keybindings at all; you can mostly pretend Emacs is a plain text editor. Thus, in this chapter I'll teach you how to:</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Create & Open a file buffer using the menu.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Read the modeline.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Insert text.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Save a file buffer using the menu.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">View a list of open buffers in the menu.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Additionally, there are some behaviors in Emacs that may be confusing while doing basic text editing. I'll tell you about these behaviors ahead of time so it's less frustrating when you first begin.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="creating-opening-file-buffers" class="almighty-section-title">Creating & Opening File Buffers</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In Emacs, creating a new file buffer and opening an existing file into a buffer are nearly the same action, making it somewhat confusing.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Let's say you want to create a new file. In the menu, navigate to<code>File-&gt;Visit New File</code>. A new minibuffer will open. In the top left of the minibuffer it will say "Find File" and show the path to the current directory. To make a new file there, type in the name of the file you want to create, like "abc.txt" or "main.lisp", then press<code>Enter</code>. A new, empty buffer with that name will open.<i>The file doesn't exist until you save it.</i></p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To navigate to other directories from that minibuffer, you can type the name of a subdirectory, or you can press<code>Backspace</code> to navigate to a parent directory instead.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Now let's say you want to open an existing file. In the menu, navigate to<code>File-&gt;Open File</code>. The identical minibuffer will open. Navigate to your file, type in its name, and press<code>Enter</code> to open the file.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="reading-the-modeline" class="almighty-section-title">Reading The Modeline</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">With a file buffer open, take a look at the bar at the bottom of the buffer. It contains important information. It's contents, from left to right:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">An icon showing the current<code>evil-mode</code> state.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">An integer showing the buffer size.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The path to the current file/buffer.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Two numbers separated by a colon. These show the current line and column of the cursor. Example:<code>50:20</code> means<code>line 50, column 20</code></p></li>
</ul>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="inserting-text" class="almighty-section-title">Inserting Text</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">By default, you are in<code>evil-mode</code>'s<code>Normal State</code>. We want to initially avoid learning any complicated systems of text editing. To do that, we can switch to<code>Emacs State</code>. Type<code>C-z</code>. In the modeline in the bottom left, you should see the icon change, probably to<code>E</code>, indicating that you are in<code>Emacs State</code>. In this state:</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You have access to all of Emacs' keybindings.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can insert, highlight, cut, copy, paste, and delete text as you usually would.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You will need to switch to<code>Emacs State</code> every time you open a new buffer.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To switch out of<code>Emacs State</code> and back into<code>Normal State</code>, type<code>C-z</code> again.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="saving-files" class="almighty-section-title">Saving Files</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can save a file using your standard keybinding<code>s-s</code>, or you can save with the menu. Navigate to<code>File-&gt;Save</code>.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="view-a-list-of-open-buffers" class="almighty-section-title">View A List Of Open Buffers</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can view a list of open buffers and switch to one in the menu. Navigate to<code>Buffers</code>. Buffers that have names like<code>*Messages*</code> are special Emacs buffers. All others should be file buffers.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you click on one of the buffers, the window with the keyboard cursor active will switch to that buffer.</p>

<h3 id="strange-behavior" class="almighty-section-title">Strange Behavior</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">That'll get you started with the basics. There are few strange behaviors to look out for, though.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="i-typed-something-once-but-it-got-repeated-several-times" class="almighty-section-title">"I typed something once but it got repeated several times."</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In<code>Emacs State</code>, if you type<code>C-u</code> and then a number<code>n</code>, the next thing you type will be repeated<code>n</code> times. If you type<code>C-u 8 d</code> you will type 8 d's.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is useful behavior when you know what's happening, confusing and frustrating when you don't. It's usually more of a problem in Evil<code>Normal State</code> because you don't even have to type<code>C-u</code>, and if you type<code>8</code>, go into<code>Insert State</code> and type in a bunch of code and then type<code>ESC</code> to go back to<code>Normal State</code>, all of the code will be repeated 8 times.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="i-can-t-type-anything-the-window-seems-locked" class="almighty-section-title">"I can't type anything; the window seems locked."</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Look at the beginning of the buffer name. Does it have a Lock icon? You may have accidentally typed<code>C-x C-q</code> or<code>SPC t r</code>, putting the buffer into read-only mode. Type<code>C-x C-q</code> or<code>SPC t r</code> again to make the buffer editable again.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="i-typed-something-and-the-buffer-changed" class="almighty-section-title">"I typed something and the buffer changed."</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You may have accidentally closed or switched the buffer. You can try switching back using the method above, or you can type<code>C-w C-u</code> to undo whatever the heck you did. We'll see later that the<code>C-w C-u</code> (<code>winner-undo</code>) command has some other uses.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And if you accidentally undid something that you want to<i>redo</i>, you can type<code>C-w C-r</code>.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="i-typed-something-and-some-minibuffer-or-prompt-came-up-and-i-want-to-just-get-rid-of-it" class="almighty-section-title">"I typed something and some minibuffer or prompt came up and I want to just get rid of it."</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Typically this happens to me when I accidently type<code>C-x k</code> to kill/close a buffer. Whatever you did, you can cancel whatever action you are in the middle of by typing<code>C-g</code> a few times.<code>C-g</code> is a universal command for canceling some action.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="my-buffer-has-a-file-open-but-i-can-only-see-part-of-it-or-perhaps-none-of-it-at-all" class="almighty-section-title">"My buffer has a file open but I can only see part of it (or perhaps none of it at all)."</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you're sure you have a file buffer open to a file that exists and has data in it, then you may be a victim of<i>narrowing</i>. You can confirm by looking at the modeline: At the beginning of the buffer/file path in the modeline, if you see two arrows, one above the other, pointing to each other, then the buffer has been narrowed.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To unnarrow or<i>widen</i>, switch to<code>Normal State</code> and type<code>SPC b -</code> (<code>doom/toggle-narrow-buffer</code>).</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="i-cut-some-text-but-when-i-try-to-paste-some-other-text-appears" class="almighty-section-title">"I cut some text, but when I try to paste, some other text appears."</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Did you cut some text, delete a word with<code>C-backspace</code>? Is that word the one being pasted?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You are experiencing expected behavior of the kill ring. You can undo everything the normal way you undo any text operation using<code>s-z</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To avoid this behavior, you need to use<code>backspace</code> or<code>delete</code> alone (erasing a character at a time). I'll cover killing later.</p>

<h3 id="lisp-images" class="almighty-section-title">Lisp Images</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">An important concept that has deep implications for Lisp development is the Lisp Image.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you first open a Common Lisp file in Emacs, a new REPL session and Lisp image is created. Code is then loaded, compiled, and executed in the image. It is sometimes likened to an operating system.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Some operations that you perform will modify image-level settings. We will see some examples later.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">An image can be saved and restored. We'll learn how to do that at the appropriate time.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="using-the-repl" class="almighty-section-title">Using the REPL</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Since a REPL was opened when you opened a Common Lisp file, you<i>can</i> switch to it using the standard menu navigation for switching buffers. However, the entire window will be taken up with the REPL, which may not be what you want.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you would like a REPL opened in a<i>minibuffer</i> under your Lisp buffer, then do the following: With a Lisp file open and the cursor in the buffer, type<code>SPC m '</code>. A Lisp REPL will be opened. The REPL/image is "attached" to the Emacs instance. If you open a different Lisp file and compile the code, it will be loaded into the same image.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="structural-editing" class="almighty-section-title">Structural Editing</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Editing Lisp code can be tricky at first.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you delete a closing-parenthesis, all of the code between and including the opening and closing parentheses will be deleted.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Deleting an end-quote will do the same.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is call "structural editing". It prevents unbalanced parentheses or quotes. However, there are some circumstances where it actually makes it difficult to fix unbalanced parentheses (usually because of copy/pasting code).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There can be a lot of confusing behavior with structural editing. To turn it off, type<code>M-x lispy-mode</code> to toggle<code>lispy-mode</code> off. With lispy-mode off, you will have more freedom, but less help from the editor. As the spirit moves, you can toggle it on and play around with it. We'll cover some useful features of structural editing later.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="the-lisp-debugger" class="almighty-section-title">The Lisp Debugger</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We will take a closer look at the debugger and errors in the chapter on errors and conditions, but before you get to that section you'll probably cause the debugger to open and display a message like this:</p>
<pre class="example" id="orga42efff">
:AWS fell through ECASE expression.
Wanted one of (:DEVELOPMENT :PRODUCTION).
   [Condition of type SB-KERNEL:CASE-FAILURE]

Restarts:
 0: [RETRY] Retry SLY evaluation request.
 1: [*ABORT] Return to SLY's top level.
 2: [ABORT] abort thread (#&lt;THREAD tid=11923 "slynk-worker" RUNNING {70071BE463}&gt;)
</pre>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In this situation, you can do two things:</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Navigate the cursor to one of the<code>restarts</code> and press<code>Enter</code>.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Type the key corresponding to the<code>restart</code> (0 for [RETRY], 1 for [*ABORT], etc.) to select it.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In the beginning, it's safest to choose whichever restart says<code>[*ABORT]</code>. If your list of restarts is too long, it will be truncated and you might need to highlight and type<code>Enter</code> on a<code>Show More</code> option.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, if you want to, you can give Common Lisp's debugger a test drive. If you cause an error, try leaving the debugger open, fixing the bug in your code (make sure to compile it), and then selecting a<code>RETRY</code> restart if one is available. This is one of Common Lisp's most powerful<b>built-in</b> features.</p>

In school, we learn math using<code>infix notation</code>, where the operators are placed between each number.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">After the opening parenthesis comes<code>defun</code>, a built-in<code>special form</code>. Special forms have different evaluation rules compared to regular function calls.<code>defun</code> is used to define a function. The function above is given the name<code>cube</code>. After giving the function a name, we define it's<code>parameters</code>, the data it takes as ~arguments= to run the operations inside the function. The function takes one argument:<code>x</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Notice that<code>cube</code> isn't evaluated as a variable. The<code>x</code> in<code>(x)</code> isn't initially interpreted as a function to be called.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>defun</code> is a special operator where the first argument it receives is a symbol designating the name to give the function, and the second argument is a list of arguments that the function is expected to receive when it's called.

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>do</code> is useful especially for people who are comfortable with iterating recursively because recursion also requires the programmer to specify the stepping function and base case.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The step function is<code>(cdr nums)</code>. Using<code>cdr</code> to step through a list is called "cdring down" the list. The similarities between the recursive method and the<code>do</code> method make it both powerful and often unergonomic. As a reader of code, when you see either a recursive or<code>do</code> iteration, you have to check the step function and base case--something you don't have to do with<code>dotimes</code>,<code>dolist</code>,<code>mapcar</code>,<code>remove-if-not</code>, etc.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To reiterate, the<code>loop</code> iterator is much more widely used than the<code>do</code> iterators, so if you wish for most other Lispers to understand your code and collaborate with others, you should generally prefer<code>loop</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you prefer a more applicative/functional style, then map/filter/reduce is the way to go.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Now we need to determine of the value of a dice roll is one of the instant win or instant loss values. To reiterate, an instant win occurs when the player rolls a 7 or 11. In other words, the combined value of the two dice must be either 7 or 11. For an instant loss, the combined value must be either 2, 3, or 12.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Functions that return<code>t</code> or<code>nil</code> (or some data that matches the check) are ended with "p" by convention.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">These two functions take a<code>dice</code>, add up their values, and then check if they equal the instant win or instant lose numbers.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Since we know that a<code>dice</code> only has two values, we could have used<code>first</code> and<code>last</code>, or<code>nth</code>, but<code>reduce</code> is pretty convenient here.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We can "roll" the dice, and we can determine an instant win or loss. Now, let's test them out together.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun play-craps ()
  (let ((dice (roll-dice)))
    (format t "~&amp;You rolled ~a and ~a" (first dice) (second dice))

          ((instant-loss-p dice) (format t "~&amp;You lose...")))))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is simple enough. In<code>play-craps</code>, we<code>roll-dice</code>, saving the value to a variable called<code>dice</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>format</code> is for printing text to the REPL or other streams. The string between quotes is called a format string. It has a complex grammar for printing and interpolating values. We will cover<code>format</code> in more detail later, but we'll start with the basics here.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>&amp;</code> will add a new line if one doesn't already exist.<code>~a</code> will interpolate a value passed to format after the format string. The first call to<code>format</code> has two values after the format string. The first one will be interpolated into the place where the first<code>~a</code> exists. The second value will be interpolated into the next<code>~a</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>cond</code> is special operator for executing code based on different conditions.<code>cond</code> is typically used when there are more than two condition checks. The<code>cond</code> block will do each check from top to bottom. It returns the value of the first condition that returns<code>t</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If the player doesn't instantly win or lose, they need to know what their "point" is. Obviously, they can do the math by looking at the values of the first and second die, but let's just make it convenient for the player.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We can throw dice and determine an instant win or loss. Now we need to give the player the ability to continue playing and roll for a point.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To keep things extra simple, we're going to ask the player to do more than just run<code>play-craps</code>. They will need to run one other function,<code>try-for-point</code>, manually inputing their "point" as an argument.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Again, we roll, but since we are going to be using the value of the dice a few times, we can save the points in<code>roll-point</code>. Notice that we use<code>let*</code> because otherwise<code>(reduce #'+ dice)</code> will return an error saying that a variable of<code>dice</code> hasn't been set. In order to use variables defined earlier in the let block, we need to use<code>let*</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In this version of the game, the player will need to repeatedly run<code>try-for-point</code> manually. We'll take a look at making a bit more ergonomic later.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For this project we'll be making a game of tic-tac-toe complete with a computer opponent. Tic-tac-toe is a relatively common coding project. The version we'll be making is by David Touretzky.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The purpose of this project is to help you get a feel for what editing code is like in Emacs. You'll have a chance to try out structural editing (if you want), and you'll get some practice with tricky forms like<code>let</code> and<code>cond</code> that use an abundance of parentheses.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Common Lisp code tends to be wider than other languages. This is partially because of the culture of using unabbreviated names, but also because of Lisp's functional programming roots. As a result, Lisp programmers often make smaller abstractions to make code more readable and fit into the line-width limits of the editor. This project will give you some exposure to both the "problem" of wider code and the solutions for it.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In order to get the most out of this project, you should follow along and actually type out the code in Emacs, rather than copying and pasting.</p>

<h5 id="explanation" class="almighty-section-title">explanation</h5>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The first step in solving a problem--like how to make a tic-tac-toe game--is to decide how we will represent data. The simpler the data representation, the simpler the rest of the code will be; thus, we want to choose the simplest data representation that can solve the problem.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Tic-tac-toe works like this:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are two players.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Each take turns putting their "piece" on the board--either an X or an O.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If either player gets three of their pieces in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, they win.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If all spaces are filled without any player winning, it's a draw.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The game is simple, so the data representation can be simple.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The board is a flat list of 0's representing empty spaces.<code>board</code> is a filler symbol to make later code more intuitive to understand. We use<code>setf</code> to assign the globally scoped<code>*board*</code> variable to the value<code>'(board 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0)</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We represent player "pieces" as 1 and 10.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are numerous advantages to representing the board as a "flat" list and the players as abstract numbers, rather than directly as the strings "X" and "O".</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Data access is trivial.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Detecting player piece positions is easy.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Adding an AI opponent is simple.</p></li>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The simple data representation we chose at the beginning has made it fairly easy to get a simple human-vs-computer tic-tac-toe game made. However, the computer is very dumb. It doesn't think ahead and doesn't recognize different human strategies. Let's change that.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Tic-tac-toe has a rather unfun characteristic: if played well by both players, every game will end in a draw.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For our computer strategies, then, we are going to be mostly reacting to the human player, recognizing different strategies and countering them perfectly. By the end, we'll totally drain what little fun can be had from the game. But the coding will be fun, so let's go.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To avoid these two scenarios, the computer must recognize possible strategies being deployed against it and react correctly.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="beyond-survival-mode" class="almighty-section-title">BEYOND SURVIVAL MODE</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In order to do any Lisp coding at all, you need to be able to edit text (duh). With Doom Emacs, you have three options: Use Emacs keybindings, use Evil keybindings, or use Emacs as much as possible like VSCode or other editors you're likely familiar with. We'll call the last one Survival Mode. So far, you've been in Survival Mode.</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You've typed<code>C-z</code> to enable Evil<code>Emacs State</code>, which enables editing using standard Emacs keybindings.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You probably turned off<code>lispy-mode</code> to avoid confusing behavior.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You edited text as usual: type, mouse click around, scroll wheel up and down, click and drag to highlight text, copy/paste with the keybindings you already know, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You've used the top menu bar or mode line to browse commands you can use while editing Lisp files.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you're still on the fence about this whole Emacs/Lisp thing, there is no shame in staying in Survival Mode. However, you probably ended up using some keybindings already for frequently used commands that you learned in the menu. This is the perfect start to learning Emacs--gradually incorporating more and more keybindings/functionality into your workflow as your power grows.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This chapter will help you increase your mastery of Emacs by introducing you to keybindings for many of the most common and useful functions in Doom Emacs, starting with text and Lisp editing, then moving on to buffers, windows, and projects.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="support-level-disclaimer" class="almighty-section-title">SUPPORT LEVEL DISCLAIMER</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">None of the functionality here is necessary to continue this book. Instead, you should consider this chapter a reference to return to whenever you are ready to add a little more Emacs functionality into your workflow.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, I won't be including any more references to the menu or using the mode line to navigate to and execute commands. For the rest of this book, I will refer to keybindings and give the names of the commands as well so that you can become familiar with the different packages and commands that are associated with different parts of Doom Emacs' functionality.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">I will also assume that you are using Evil<code>Normal State</code> at least partially. If you are in<code>Emacs State</code> and the keybindings aren't working, type<code>M-x</code> and type in the name of the command I am referencing. Some commands may not have keybindings in<code>Emacs State</code>, or they may be confusing.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Example:<code>evil-delete-line</code> will not have a keybinding in<code>Emacs State</code> and<code>org-kill-line</code> in<code>Normal State</code> is bound to<code>&lt;deleteline&gt;</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">I won't be testing any of the keybindings in<code>Emacs State</code>. If you want to use<code>Emacs State</code> exclusively you<i>might</i> be able to run some keybindings using<code>M-SPC</code> instead of<code>SPC</code>, but not all commands have such alternative bindings.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">I will only test keybindings in<code>lisp-mode</code>; other modes may have different bindings, or commands that do similar but subtly different things may share bindings in different major modes.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="setting-expectations" class="almighty-section-title">SETTING EXPECTATIONS</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Learning Evil bindings + Doom Emacs exclusive bindings will take time. Expect to stumble around for two weeks, feel somewhat productive in two months, and proficient in about 6-12 months. As always, focus on the keybindings and features that seem most useful to the task at hand--learning Common Lisp--and learn more Emacs as you learn more Common Lisp.</p>

<h3 id="evil-bindings" class="almighty-section-title">Evil Bindings</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">By default,<code>evil-mode</code> is available and active in Doom Emacs. This means that you have access to both Emac's default bindings as well as bindings typical of Vim/Neovim.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you don't already know how to use the Neovim keybindings, you can check out<a href="https://openvim.com">https://openvim.com</a> or<a href="https://vim-adventures.com/">https://vim-adventures.com/</a>. Both provide an interactive experience for learning the VIM text navigation keybindings.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>evil</code> uses several different editing states. The three most common are Normal, Insert, and Visual. In<code>Normal State</code>, you navigate and run commands, often starting with<code>SPC</code>. In<code>Insert State</code>, you can edit text. In<code>Visual State</code>, you can select and act upon regions of text.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">These states are set on a per-buffer basis. The state of the current buffer is displayed on the left side of the mode line.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Whenever a keybinding in this book mentions a keybinding starting with<code>SPC</code>, I assume you are in Evil<code>Normal State</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's common to accidently hit a key or combination of keys you didn't mean to. If you are "stuck" inside<i>some</i> command, or in the middle of a keybinding, the quickest solution is to press<code>C-g</code> a few times.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you don't know VIM/evil keybindings, you probably won't<i>want</i> to do this, but you may accidently do so. For example, you may be in Evil<code>Normal State</code>, press 9, enter<code>Insert State</code> and type something, then return to<code>Normal State</code> with<code>ESC</code>, at which point you now have inserted the same text 9 times. It might look something like this:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The best thing to do in this situation is just undo and retype.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This functionality can be quite useful. For example, if you want to navigate down 10 lines, you can type<code>10 j</code> in<code>Normal State</code> to navigate down ten lines. It also makes it easy to type decorative dividers in comments like this:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you want to rename a few instances of a symbol in a<code>defun</code>, multiediting is the right tool for the job. If you want to rename a function throughout a file, there is a better tool for the job: VIM search and replace.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To begin using it, just type<code>:</code> (<code>evil-ex</code>). How you proceed from there depends on how sophisticated your search and replace operation needs to be. The simplest case is replacing all instances of some text throughout the buffer:</p>
<pre class="example" id="org6ea94ac">
:%s/TEXT TO REPLACE/TEXT TO REPLACE IT WITH/g
</pre>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This search and replace tool is very powerful, but a full treatment is out of the scope of this book.

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Buffers are the most fundamental abstraction in Emacs. A buffer is a named place that displays some data. Usually buffers display the contents of text files, but they can also point to Emacs-specific functionality like the<code>*scratch*</code>,<code>*Messages*</code>, or<code>*Org-Agenda*</code> buffers. Some buffers may be called<code>minibuffers</code>. Minibuffers are typically designed to be ephemeral, like the buffer that appears when you type<code>M-x</code> to run some command.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To open a file buffer, type<code>C-x C-f</code> or<code>SPC f f</code> to run<code>find-file</code>. You can open a file that already exists, or you can navigate to a directory and/or file that doesn't exist, type<code>Enter</code>, and create a buffer for that location. The file/directory doesn't exist until you save the buffer.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Besides file buffers, there are many other kinds of buffers. The most important buffer to know as a beginner is the<code>M-x</code> command minibuffer. There you can get a list of function you can (possibly) run. There are many commands that aren't bound to keybindings that you may want to use on occasion (or perhaps you would like bind them to a custom key command).</p>

<h3 id="scratch-buffer" class="almighty-section-title">Scratch Buffer</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The scratch buffer is a buffer that can be opened to use the same way "scratch" paper is use--to do a little work that you'll quickly save somewhere else or discard after a short time. You can open it with<code>SPC x</code>. Once in the buffer, you can change the mode using<code>M-x</code> and typing in the mode.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="switching-buffers" class="almighty-section-title">Switching Buffers</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can switch buffers by typing<code>C-x b</code> or<code>SPC b B</code> (<code>consult-buffer</code>). You will be presented with a minibuffer listing all buffers that are open. Unlike<code>list-buffers</code>, you can navigate the list of buffers using<code>C-n/C-p</code> and peak at the buffer before switching to it. The minibuffer is smaller and disappears after you select a buffer to switch to.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can't mouse click buffers in the list to switch to them. You have to either type the name (often the ideal way to switch to a buffer anyway) or use Emacs keybindings to move the cursor up and down the list with<code>C-n</code> an<code>C-p</code> and select with<code>Enter</code>.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="closing-buffers" class="almighty-section-title">Closing Buffers</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To close the active buffer, type<code>s-k</code> or<code>SPC b k</code>. If you want to close multiple buffers, you can type<code>C-x C-b</code> to run<code>list-buffers</code>. Inside the<code>*Buffer List*</code> buffer, you can mark a buffer to close with<code>d</code>. After marking all of the buffers you want to close, you can "execute" the closing with<code>x</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Different minibuffers often can be closed with simpler keybindings like<code>ESC</code> or<code>q</code>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-more-information-about-a-buffer" class="almighty-section-title">Getting More Information About A Buffer</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">As you get more experience with Emacs, you may want to know how something works. Many functions--especially in a distribution like Doom--are not native functions. They are often available because of a major or minor mode created by a certain package that's installed. Thus, learning more about the environment can help you come to grips with what package does what and what other functionality is available but "hidden".</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="getting-information-about-major-minor-modes" class="almighty-section-title">Getting Information About Major & Minor Modes</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can get more information about the major and minor modes of the active buffer using<code>C-h m</code> or<code>SPC h m</code> (<code>describe-mode</code>). A minibuffer listing all the modes--including all of the functions/keybindings those modes provide--will appear.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="getting-information-about-a-function" class="almighty-section-title">Getting Information About A Function</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can go deeper and find information about a function with<code>C-h o</code> or<code>SPC h o</code> (<code>describe-symbol</code>) and then typing in an Emacs Lisp symbol or function name. Documentation and the actual code of the function will be made available in a minibuffer.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The documentation that<code>describe-symbol</code> shows includes keybindings for the function. Unlike the<code>M-x</code> minibuffer, you can see all of the bindings for a single function (many functions have multiple bindings, as you've probably noticed already). The<code>M-x</code> minibuffer will only show one binding.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="getting-information-about-a-keybinding" class="almighty-section-title">Getting Information About A Keybinding</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Maybe you know a keybinding but don't know or remember the function that the keybinding calls? Maybe you hit a key that did something surprising and want to know what the heck it was?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In that case, you can use<code>C-h k</code> or<code>SPC h k</code> (<code>describe-key</code>). You will be prompted to type the keybinding you want to know more about.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To browse keybindings and functions, you can either type<code>M-x</code> to open a list of all commands, or you can open<code>embark-bindings</code> with<code>C-h b b</code> or<code>SPC h b b</code>. embark-bindings is especially useful because it only shows the keybindings available in the current buffer.<code>describe-mode</code> also shows all of the functions a mode provides, but only shows a maximum of one binding per function. Embark bindings shows you all of them. Additionally,<code>embark-bindings</code> lets you search<i>keybindings</i>. For example, you can search for "C-c" and find all keybindings that include<code>C-c</code> in any of them. This will be especially useful for cases where you might not know the<i>exact</i> keybinding you are looking for, or if you're looking for an open keybinding in a buffer you want to make a custom shortcut for.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="getting-familiar-with-windows" class="almighty-section-title">Getting Familiar With Windows</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In Emacs, a "frame" is what most people would call a window: an operating system-level defined space to display the contents of an application.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Emacs uses the word "window" differently from how operating systems do. Emacs windows are separate places where buffers can be displayed. Buffers, of course, show either file contents or things like the Lisp REPL. A frame can be subdivided into many windows, each displaying a single buffer at a time.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Opening, closing, and navigating between windows are essential skills for using Emacs. Now that you know the basics of Lisp, it's time to become more familiar with windows.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="splitting-closing-windows" class="almighty-section-title">Splitting & Closing Windows</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can split a window vertically or horizontally (creating another window).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To split vertically, type<code>C-x 2</code> or<code>SPC w s</code>.
To split horizontally, type<code>C-x 3</code> or<code>SPC w v</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can delete a window with<code>C-x 0</code> or<code>SPC w d</code>, or you can close all<i>except</i> the currently selected window with<code>C-x 1</code> or<code>C-w C-o</code>.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="moving-between-windows" class="almighty-section-title">Moving Between Windows</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">While you can use the mouse to move the cursor around, eventually you'll want to learn to use keybindings instead. Trust me, it's nice.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="ace-window" class="almighty-section-title">Ace window</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can use the<code>ace-window</code> packages' functionality to switch windows. Type<code>C-x o</code> or<code>C-w C-w</code> to run<code>ace-window</code>. If there are only two windows open, then it will move the cursor to the one that isn't currently active. If however, you have three or more windows open,<code>ace-window</code> will display letters at the top left of each buffer. Typing the letter displayed in a window will move the cursor to that window.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This method is my preferred method of switching windows because it works regardless of what Evil state or Emacs major mode I'm in. It's also more direct. However, it does require some getting used to. As a beginner, you can't predict what letter you can use to switch to a window. Thus, in the beginning this method will often be slower then the next method I'll introduce to you.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="evil-window" class="almighty-section-title">Evil window</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The next method uses<code>evil-window</code> keybindings. With<code>evil</code> navigation, in Normal State, you navigate the cursor one line up and down with<code>j</code> and<code>k</code>, and one character left and right with<code>h</code> and<code>l</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Using this familiar navigation method, you switch windows like this:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w l</code> or<code>C-w l</code> (<code>evil-window-right</code>), move the cursor one window to the right.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w h</code> or<code>C-w h</code> (<code>evil-window-left</code>), move the cursor one window to the left.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w j</code> or<code>C-w j</code> (<code>evil-window-down</code>), move the cursor one window down.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w k</code> or<code>C-w k</code> (<code>evil-window-down</code>), move the cursor one window up.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's simple and effective. Even with experience, you may prefer it over using<code>ace-window</code>. However, as I said above, all of these shortcuts require you to be in Evil Normal State (<code>C-w</code> in Insert State is mapped to<code>evil-delete-backward-word</code>).</p>

</article>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="moving-window-positions" class="almighty-section-title">Moving Window Positions</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The above commands move the<i>cursor</i> from one window to another. It's also possible to move a window from one position to another.</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w L</code> or<code>C-w L</code> (<code>+evil/window-move-right</code>)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w H</code> or<code>C-w H</code> (<code>+evil/window-move-left</code>)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w J</code> or<code>C-w J</code> (<code>+evil/window-move-down</code>)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w K</code> or<code>C-w K</code> (<code>+evil/window-move-up</code>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Technically, it's more like you are switching<i>buffers</i> between windows. What this means is that all windows maintain their current size; if you have one large window and one small window, if you run one of the above commands while the cursor is in the large window, the buffer in that window will appear in the smaller window</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="resizing-windows" class="almighty-section-title">Resizing Windows</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You probably won't find yourself resizing windows very often. Sometimes Emacs will do some weird resizing of windows for certain actions (keep an eye out when using<code>sly-sticker-replay</code>, introduced in a later chapter) that you need to fix, you might want to dedicate a window to a certain buffer (such as the<code>org-agenda</code> buffer, introduced in a later chapter) and keep it open, and thus want to make the window smaller. Or maybe you really need to micro-adjust everything.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can use the mouse to resize windows (click and drag the border between windows). It's honestly not such a bad idea since it will likely be an infrequent activity. However, it's also possible to resize windows with keybindings.</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>C-x {</code> (<code>shrink-window-horizontally</code>) or<code>SPC w &gt;</code> or<code>C-w &gt;</code> (<code>evil-window-increase-width</code>).</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>C-x }</code> (<code>enlarge-window-horizontally</code>) or<code>SPC w &lt;</code> or<code>C-w &lt;</code> (<code>evil-window-decrease-width</code>).</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w +</code> or<code>C-w +</code> (<code>evil-window-increase-height</code>)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>SPC w -</code> or<code>C-w -</code> (<code>evil-window-decrease-height</code>)</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Each of the above commands will resize by one line or character. If you are in<code>evil</code> Normal State, you can type a number<code>n</code> and then run the command<code>n</code> times. In Normal State, typing<code>50 SPC w &gt;</code> will increase the window width by 50 characters.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can also make one window larger than all your other windows using<code>C-w o</code> or<code>SPC w o</code> (<code>doom/window-enlargen</code>).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can make all windows equal in size with<code>SPC w =</code> or<code>C-w =</code> (<code>balance-windows</code>).</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="undoing-changes" class="almighty-section-title">Undoing Changes</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Undoing any change is simple:<code>C-w u</code> or<code>SPC w u</code> (<code>winner-undo</code>).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is useful not only for typos (for example, maybe you accidentally typed<code>C-x C-x a</code> and accidently closed all but one window) or for strange changes made by Emacs (sometimes closing a minibuffer drastically resizes other windows for no known reason), but also for intentional changes. For example, the above<code>doom/window-enlargen</code> command drastically resizes all windows. You can undo that change with<code>winner-undo</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>winner-undo</code> no only undoes window resizes, but any changes to windows. If you accidentally closed a window, you can undo with<code>winner-undo</code>. If you move a window, you can undo the move. It's perhaps one of the most essential commands for beginners who are most likely to make mistakes or be faced with strange changes in window arrangements they weren't expecting.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Of course, you can also run<code>winner-redo</code> with<code>C-w C-r</code> or<code>SPC w C-r</code></p>

However, if you want switch between<i>project</i> buffers, you can use<code>C-c p b</code> or<code>SPC b b</code>. The exact function is called depends on the<code>:completion</code> library you chose in the<code>init.el</code> file when we first installed Doom Emacs.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

<h3 id="searching-in-projects" class="almighty-section-title">Searching In Projects</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are two kinds of searches: filename searches and text searches.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="filename-searches" class="almighty-section-title">Filename searches</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can search for a file within your project using<code>SPC SPC</code> (<code>projectile-find-file</code>). Searching with the normal<code>find-file</code> begins with a view of files within a directory, then you need to navigate to the directory and file you want. With<code>projectile-find-file</code>, all files in your project root directory--including subdirectories--will be available to search.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is a very powerful feature allowing quick searching. If you know you have a file in<code>src/system/components/ui/button.lisp</code>, you can type<code>SPC SPC ui but Enter</code> and open the file without doing any scrolling or navigation of your filesystem.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="project-text-search-replace" class="almighty-section-title">Project text search & replace</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can search for some text within the files of your project using<code>SPC /</code> (<code>+default/search-project</code>).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">While searching, you can type<code>C-c C-e</code> (<code>embark-export</code>) to export all the search matches to an<i>editable buffer</i>. Inside the buffer, you can type<code>Enter</code> on individual matches to go to the file to see context. In the Embark buffer, after editing the buffer, you can save changes to all of the files with<code>C-c C-c</code>, or discard changes with<code>C-c C-k</code>.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="project-tree-view" class="almighty-section-title">Project Tree View</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>treemacs</code> provides a tree view of your project. Open it with<code>SPC o p</code> (<code>+treemacs/toggle</code>).</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="switching-to-treemacs-buffer" class="almighty-section-title">Switching to treemacs buffer</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you have a treemacs buffer open and move away from it into another buffer, if you use<code>ace-window</code>, ace-window won't give you the option of switching to the treemacs buffer. You either need to use one of the<code>evil-window-</code> commands from the previous chapter, or toggle the treemacs buffer closed and reopen it.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="opening-files" class="almighty-section-title">Opening Files</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In addition to using treemacs to browse your project, you can open files by typing<code>Enter</code> while highlighting a file.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="renaming-files" class="almighty-section-title">Renaming Files</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">While highlighting a file, type<code>R</code> to rename it.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The advantage of using treemacs to rename files is this: if the file is open in a buffer, treemacs will automatically (or in some cases, provide you the option to) rename<i>the open buffer for the file</i>, too. The other usual means of renaming files (<code>rename-file</code>) doesn't automatically rename the buffer.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you rename a directory, and you have files in the directory open in buffers,<i>those buffers will also be renamed</i>.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="moving-files" class="almighty-section-title">Moving Files</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">While highlighting a file, type<code>m</code> to move it. You will be asked where to move it.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you move a file that is currently open in a buffer, treemacs will ask if you want to delete the open buffer. If you don't delete it and save the buffer, you will recreate the file in the old location.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Unfortunately, if you move a directory with files from that directory open in buffers, those buffers won't be renamed and you won't be prompted to kill them, so you will need to do that yourself.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="deleting-files" class="almighty-section-title">Deleting Files</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">While highlighting a file or directory, type<code>d</code> to delete it. You'll be prompted to confirm you want to delete the file.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Similarly for moving directories, if you have files open from a directory you delete, treemacs will not delete the buffers for you.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="bulk-actions" class="almighty-section-title">Bulk Actions</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you need to delete, copy, or move multiple files, you can type<code>M-m</code> to be given options for the currently highlighted file.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="the-lisp-coding-environment" class="almighty-section-title">THE LISP CODING ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">I've already introduced some essential functions and keybindings for coding Lisp in Emacs. Now that you have a basic knowledge of both Lisp and Emacs commands for coding in Lisp, it will be useful to gain a deeper knowledge of the Lisp IDE in Emacs.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Common Lisp includes debugging functions like<code>trace</code>,<code>break</code>, etc. that allow you to do debugging directly in the REPL.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, there are Common Lisp IDEs that help improve the ergonomics of using the debugger. One of those IDEs is Sly, which was installed when we configured the<code>init.el</code> file to include<code>common-lisp</code> language support.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="sly-backtrace-navigation" class="almighty-section-title">SLY BACKTRACE NAVIGATION</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are some functions within the Sly debugger that we can use for simple navigation. They all are prefixed with<code>sly-db-</code> and are discoverable if you run<code>embark-bindings</code> with<code>SPC h b b</code> or<code>C-h b b</code>. We'll look at a few of them here.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-db-up-sly-db-down" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-db-up= & =sly-db-down=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Move the cursor up or down the stack in the backtrace with<code>C-k</code> and<code>C-j</code>. If the cursor is not highlighting any frames in the stack, the cursor will first move to the top frame if you run<code>sly-db-down</code>.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-db-toggle-details" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-db-toggle-details=</h3>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-db-show-frame-source" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-db-show-frame-source=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you bring the cursor over a stack frame in the backtrace and press the<code>v</code> key, Sly will open the source code file for that line in the backtrace and briefly highlight the exact form that executed in that frame. Useful for navigating straight to possible sources of error.</p>

<h2 id="tracing" class="almighty-section-title">TRACING</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Beyond simple navigation within the debugger is actual debugging methods and tools.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Tracing is a debugging method that shows a form as it is called and then what it returns. Tracing is typically used for recursive functions.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-fancy-trace" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-fancy-trace=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Let's say you have this function:</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-trace-dialog-toggle-trace" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-trace-dialog-toggle-trace=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Alternatively, you can trace using<code>sly-trace-dialog-toggle-trace</code> via<code>C-c C-t</code> or<code>SPC m T T</code>. The difference is that fancy trace will show the trace in the REPL, whereas the trace dialog toggle requires you to open the trace dialog with<code>C-c T</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you use the trace dialog, you get output like this:</p>

<h2 id="stickers" class="almighty-section-title">STICKERS</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Where Sly's debugging capabilities really shine is with<code>stickers</code>. Stickers are basically a replacement for<code>print</code> and<code>break</code> functions</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-stickers-dwim" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-stickers-dwim=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Let's say we have the following code:</p>

</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And you're thinking, "Hmm, I wonder what the result of that addition was?"</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You could wrap it in<code>print</code>. Or you could use a sticker. Highlight the opening parenthesis of the addition form then use<code>sly-stickers-dwim</code> via<code>C-c C-s C-s</code> or<code>SPC m s s</code> to place a sticker on it. After placing the sticker, you need to recompile the function (<code>C-c C-c</code>) to "arm" the sticker.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-stickers-replay" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-stickers-replay=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">With the sticker armed, when you run the function, the return value of the form you placed the sticker on will be recorded. You can view the recording with<code>sly-stickers-replay</code> using<code>C-c C-s C-r</code> or<code>SPC m s r</code>.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-stickers-toggle-break-on-stickers-sly-db-step" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-stickers-toggle-break-on-stickers= & =sly-db-step=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can also configure Sly to break when computation reaches the sticker using<code>sly-stickers-toggle-break-on-stickers</code> via<code>SPC m s b</code>. During computation, when a sticker is reached, the debugger will open with a message like this:</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgc745868">
#&lt;JUST BEFORE #&lt;STICKER id=145 hit-count=1&gt;&gt;
   [Condition of type SLYNK-STICKERS::JUST-BEFORE-STICKER]
</pre>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The sticker will also flash in the source code file window. Useful for when you have multiple stickers and need to know which one you're looking at.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you choose the<code>CONTINUE</code> restart (either via<code>c</code> or<code>0</code> or navigating to<code>[CONTINUE]</code> and typing<code>Enter</code>) or you use<code>sly-db-step</code> via<code>s</code> in the debugger window, you will see a message like this:</p>
<pre class="example" id="org8a8dba9">
#&lt;RIGHT-AFTER #&lt;STICKER id=255 hit-count=2&gt; (recorded #&lt;RECORDING 1 values&gt;)&gt;
   [Condition of type SLYNK-STICKERS::RIGHT-AFTER-STICKER]
</pre>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">...and the return value of the form where the sticker is placed.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="sly-stepper" class="almighty-section-title">=sly-stepper=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you are having trouble tracking down the exact location of your error, you can perform a comprehensive sweep using<code>sly-stepper</code> with<code>C-c C-s P</code>. That will apply stickers to every form inside a function. After running<code>sly-stepper</code>, compile the function to arm the stickers.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>sly-stickers-replay</code> is especially useful because, like with the breaking option, it will open the source code file and flash the exact sticker whose value it's displaying. You can also navigate to the next sticker with<code>n</code>,<i>or the previous one</i> with<code>p</code>. Every time you move forward or backward in the replay, the stickers will flash. This makes a bit easier to follow the control flow of the code.</p>

<h2 id="restructuring-code-with-ease" class="almighty-section-title">RESTRUCTURING CODE WITH EASE</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Writing Lisp code often involves moving forms around or wrapping forms in new forms. If you're using<code>lispy-mode</code> or<code>lispyville-mode</code>--both turned on with Doom's<code>lispy</code> config in the<code>init.el</code> file--you can more easily build out and modify Lisp code.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="slurping-and-barfing" class="almighty-section-title">Slurping and barfing</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Slurping and barfing are terms for describing moving parentheses to either include or exclude forms from other forms. Let me show you what I mean.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In the tic-tac-toe project, we wrote code to find positions on the board to win or block the opponent's win. To begin, we wrote this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-if #'(lambda (triplet) (= 20 (sum-triplet *test-board* triplet))) *triplets*)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This finds any triplet that sums to 20 on the board. But we then wanted to search the result of that<code>find-if</code> form to search for the empty space in the triplet.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-if #'(lambda (element) (= (nth element board) 0))
         (find-if #'(lambda (triplet) (= 20 (sum-triplet *test-board* triplet))) *triplets*))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you use structural editing, this can actually be difficult at first. You might naturally try to write the code like this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-if #'(lambda (element) (= (nth element board) 0)))
(find-if #'(lambda (triplet) (= 20 (sum-triplet *test-board* triplet))) *triplets*)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And then, in order to wrap the bottom<code>find-if</code> form with the top<code>find-if</code> form, you might try to delete the final parenthesis of the top<code>find-if</code> and then move it to the end of the bottom<code>find-if</code> form:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-if #'(lambda (element) (= (nth element board) 0)) ; deleted paren
(find-if #'(lambda (triplet) (= 20 (sum-triplet *test-board* triplet))) *triplets*)) ; added paren
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">What actually happens, however, is that the entire top<code>find-if</code> form is deleted when you try to delete just the last parenthesis! This very confusing behavior is from<code>lispy-mode</code>. It is designed to keep parentheses balanced at all times.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you want to move only one parenthesis, then, what do you do?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">One option would be to<code>kill</code> the<code>find-if</code> form intended to become the inner form...</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-if #'(lambda (element) (= (nth element board) 0)) ; bottom form killed
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">and then paste it at the end of the outer<code>find-if</code>...</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is okay, but there is an even easier method called<code>slurping</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Start with this code:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-if #'(lambda (element) (= (nth element board) 0)))
(find-if #'(lambda (triplet) (= 20 (sum-triplet *test-board* triplet))) *triplets*)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Place the cursor on the last parenthesis of the top form. While still in Evil Normal mode (not Insert mode), press<code>&gt;</code> (the<code>lispyville-mode</code> keybinding for<code>lispyville-slurp</code>). The parenthesis will move to the<b>end</b> of the bottom<code>find-if</code> form, making it an inner nested form.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Slurping is especially useful for any time you need to "build out" from some code. Consider this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-if #'(lambda (triple)
             (= (sum-triple *test-board* triple) target-sum))
         *triples*)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is how we started building out the code for detecting squeezes. But then we realized that we needed to add more conditions. For a strategy to be a squeeze, the triplet need to sum to the target,<b>and</b> it needs to be diagonal as well as some other conditions. That means that we needed to wrap several predicate functions in an<code>and</code> form.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">;; These need to be wrapped in an (and ...) form
(= (sum-triple board triple) target-sum)
(diagonal-p triple)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We can do that by first writing the<code>and</code> form before the other two forms:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(and) (= (sum-triple board triple) target-sum)
(diagonal-p triple)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Put the Evil Normal-mode cursor on the end paren of the<code>and</code> form, and then<code>slurp</code> up the other two forms.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(and (= (sum-triple board triple) target-sum)
     (diagonal-p triple))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Once we added the rest of the conditions, we wanted to then bind the return value of the<code>find-if</code> form to a local variable using<code>let</code>. The process looks like this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">;; Write the LET and variable we want in the LET.
;; let               Finished find-if
(let ((squeeze-p))) (find-if #'(lambda (triple)
             (and (= (sum-triple board triple) target-sum)
                  (diagonal-p triple)
                  (not (human-in-middle-p board))
                  (side-empty-p board)))
         *triples*)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Then use<code>lispyville-slurp</code> on the three ending parentheses of the<code>let</code> form to complete the new form.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">After adding an<code>if</code> form, we need to make this a function, so we can write the function definition above the entire<code>let</code> form:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun detect-squeeze (board target-sum))
(let ((squeeze-p
        (find-if #'(lambda (triple)
                     (and (= (sum-triple board triple) target-sum)
                          (diagonal-p triple)
                          (not (human-in-middle-p board))
                          (side-empty-p board)))
                 *triples*)))
  (if squeeze-p
      (find-empty-position board *sides*)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And then just slurp up the entire<code>let</code> into the<code>defun</code> form.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Again, you<i>could</i> just<code>kill</code> and<code>paste</code> the forms around, but killing can sometimes be dangerous (if you kill a word using<code>M-backspace</code>, you've just replaced your function in the kill-ring). It's nicer to simply keep the code on the screen and using slurp to do what you want.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The reverse of<code>slurp</code> is<code>barf</code>, bound to<code>&lt;</code> in Doom Emacs<code>lispyville-mode</code>. I don't find it nearly as useful as slurping, but maybe you can find a use for it.</p>

<h3 id="dragging-forms-forward-backward" class="almighty-section-title">Dragging forms forward/backward</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Another operation you'll probably want to do a lot is move forms around. For example, maybe you wrote this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun choose-move (board)
  (or (make-three-in-a-row board)
      (block-opponent-win board)
      (take-random-position board)
      (block-two-on-one-play board)
      (block-squeeze-play board)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Then you realized that the<code>block-two-on-one</code> and<code>block-squeeze-play</code> strategies need to take higher priority over all but the<code>make-three-in-a-row</code> strategy. You could, of course, kill/paste them into the proper position. But if you want, you can also use<code>lispyville-drag-backward</code>--bound to<code>M-k</code>--while the cursor is on the opening parentheses of the<code>block-</code> forms to move them.<code>lispyville-drag-forward</code>--bound to<code>M-j</code>--goes in the opposite direction.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">They also work on individual symbols. For example, let's say you have a call to<code>nth</code>:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(nth 4 my-list)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But then you decide you want to use<code>member</code> instead.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(member 4 my-list)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Unfortunately, you now need to switch the location of 4 and<code>my-list</code> in the arguments to<code>member</code>. Fortunately, you can use<code>lispyville-drag-</code> functions for that, too. Place the cursor over the 4 and use<code>lispyville-drag-forward</code> (<code>M-j</code>) to switch the 4 and<code>my-list</code>.</p>

<h3 id="pretty-printing-objects" class="almighty-section-title">Pretty Printing Objects</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are several generic functions worth knowing about when you first start using Lisp. One of them is<code>print-object</code>--used for pretty printing objects.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmethod print-object ((this creature) stream)
  (with-slots (name territory) this
    (format stream "~a ~a" name territory)))

(make-instance 'creature :name "Cat" :territory "House")
                                        ; =&gt; Cat House
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>with-slots</code> is a useful macro for dealing with object data. You could use<code>let</code> instead...</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((name (slot-value this 'name))
      (territory (slot-value this 'territory)))
  ...)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But<code>with-slots</code> is nicer for this purpose. There is also<code>with-accessors</code>, which is equivalent to using<code>creature-name</code> and<code>creature-territory</code> instead of<code>slot-value</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In the case of<code>print-object</code>, it's safest to stick with<code>with-slots</code> or<code>slot-value</code>. If you change the accessor, you might end up with difficult to debug errors when printing objects.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Another common error would be to try to print slot values that aren't bound. That's why you should probably have<code>:initform</code> set to<code>nil</code> if you have no other desired default value; you won't have trouble with<code>UNBOUND SLOT</code> errors.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defclass beverage ()
  ((name :initarg :name :accessor name)

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Since we didn't bind any of the slots--neither in the call to<code>make-instance</code> nor in the class definition with<code>:initform</code>--we get the<code>&lt;&lt;error printing object&gt;&gt;</code> message.

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Let's say we have the following<code>defclass</code>:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

  ((name :initarg :name
         :initform nil
         :accessor user-name)
   (email :initarg :email

          :accessor user-email)))
</code></pre>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We've specified the type of data the slots will hold: strings.</p>

</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It works, but what we really want is:</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Both slots to be required.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To validate that the value assigned in<code>email</code> is actually an email.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We can do that using two important features of Common Lisp's object system: custom initializer methods and method modifiers.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To validate that the email is a valid email, we would like to be able to use regular expressions. Lisp doesn't have regular expression support built in, so we'll use the<code>ppcre</code> package to give us regular expressions:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(ql:quickload "cl-ppcre")
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Then we'll make a function for validating that the string passed to<code>make-instance</code> is a valid email.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun valid-email-address-p (string)
  (not (null
        (ppcre:scan "^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$" string))))

                                        ; =&gt; NIL
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Now we just need some way to run this function when we run<code>make-instance</code>. To do that, we can use custom initialization with the<code>initialize-instance</code> method.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmethod initialize-instance :before ((this user) &amp;key name email)

  (unless email
    (error "Email is required."))
  (unless (valid-email-address-p email)
    (error "~a is not a valid email." email)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>initialize-instance</code> is a generic method run whenever an object is created. Using the<code>:before</code> method modifier, we can run some code before the main<code>initialize-instance</code> method. Here, we ensure that the name and email slots are bound and that the email is valid. Importantly, if the data doesn't pass the checks, the developer is thrown into the debugger, and the object is never created.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In Lisp, a list is a linked-list. Arrays, on the other hand, are surprisingly similar to the arrays in C. You need to manually set their size at creation time. Resizing them involves either assigning them a special property or simply recreating the array with the new size.</p>

<h3 id="kinds-of-arrays" class="almighty-section-title">Kinds of arrays</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are several different kinds of arrays. They include:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Vectors (one-dimensional arrays)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Multi-dimensional arrays</p></li>

<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Strings</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Because my goal is to cover the essentials for getting started with Common Lisp and arrays are largely for optimization, we won't go into great detail about arrays.</p>

<h1 id="macros" class="almighty-chapter-title">MACROS</h1>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="the-forbidden-fruit" class="almighty-section-title">The Forbidden Fruit</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Macros are a controversial feature of Lisp. On the one hand, they are one of the main reasons why Lisp is so powerful and flexible. They are a defining feature, enabling a masterful macro writer to bend the language to his will. There are no limits; you can rewrite the language in your own image.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's such a compelling feature that I use it to advertise this book.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">On the other hand, many experienced users of Lisp warn against the use of macros. While some Lisp advocates strongly encourage the use of macros, Peter Norvig in Paradigms of Artificial Intelligence Programming writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The first step in writing a macro is to recognize that every time you write one, you are defining a new language .... Introducing a macro puts much more memory strain on the reader of your program than does introducing a function, variable or data type, so it should not be taken lightly. Introduce macros only when there is a clear need, and when the macro fits in well with your existing system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In other words, macros are powerful and require experience to use properly. In fact, they require experience just to understand their value and power. Many Lisp-skeptics question whether their benefits are worth the cost of using a niche language like Lisp over languages with more energetic ecosystems.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Lisp advocates find it challenging to convince skeptics to give Lisp a serious look because demonstrating the value of macros for common programming tasks is honestly not possible, and it's easy to imagine the nightmare of domain specific languages all over the place written by people unqualified to write more than a CRUD app (like me). Macros are something that need to be experienced to be understood--similar to Lisp's image-based programming model. Unfortunately, "You have to try it to understand" sounds a lot like cope from delusional nerds advocating for solutions without recognizing the weaknesses of their solutions (something nerds are wont to do).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, Lisp-curious programmers are often attracted to the<i>platonic ideal</i> of macros. Its the One Ring, the fruit when eaten that grants forbidden knowledge that they hope will give them an edge over the programmers using lesser languages. When faced with a problem, macros are the first thing that these people (maybe even you, my smart and handsome customer) want to try to use to solve the problem. The warnings of the graybeards make macros ever more tantalizing, and the macro-skeptics create an opponent in the mind of the macro-maximalist who sees them as the losers they will crush when they finally unlock the true potential of meta programming.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you're reading this, you are likely among those curious to learn more about macros in particular. Because macros are such a deep subject, even if I were a macro wizard (which I am not), I couldn't provide a tutorial expansive and worthy enough to be called complete. Here in this chapter I can only teach the essential things to know about macros. See the RESOURCES chapter to get a list of resources for learning more about macros and more.</p>

<h2 id="defining-macros" class="almighty-section-title">Defining Macros</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">As you can see, macros significantly reduce the amount of visual noise in the code and make it easier to understand. But after looking at the code it expands into, you might wonder how the heck you even get started writing a macro at all?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To begin defining a macro, first you need to do some wishful thinking.</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Write the desired call.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Write the desired expansion.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Construct macro parameter list from call.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For example, let's say you want to define a<code>when-let</code> macro that combines<code>let</code> and<code>when</code> into one form. First, you begin with the macro call you want to have:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(when-let (user (get-user id))
  (welcome-message user)
  (redirect-to-dashboard user))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Then, you write the code you want it to expand into:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((user (get-user id)))
  (when user
    (welcome-message user)
    (redirect-to-dashboard user)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Finally, you write the macro definition.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro when-let ((var expression) &amp;body body)
  `(let ((,var ,expression))
     (when ,var
       ,@body)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Before we go further, first you need to understand backquotes.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="backquotes" class="almighty-section-title">Backquotes</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In the previous code, you saw a backquote in the form<code>`(let ...)</code>. Backquotes are like normal single-quotes--they are an abbreviation of<code>quote</code>, which returns the literal representation of some code.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(quote (+ 2 2))
                                        ; =&gt; (+ 2 2)
'(+ 2 2)
                                        ; =&gt; (+ 2 2)
`(+ 2 2)
                                        ; =&gt; (+ 2 2)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Notice that those symbols aren't interpreted. They and the list they are included in are returned as-is.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Backquotes have an important feature: you can tell the interpreter to actually evaluate some of parts of the code.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="comma-in-backquotes" class="almighty-section-title">Comma In Backquotes</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To tell the interpreter to evaluate parts inside a backquoted form, type<code>,</code> before the part you want evaluated.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((a 2)
      (b 3))
  `((+ ,a ,b) is ,(+ a b)))
                                        ; =&gt; ((+ 2 3) IS 5)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are some rules you have to follow when using backquotes:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">A comma must follow a backquote.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">A comma can't follow another comma.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For example:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((a 2)
      (b 3))
  ;; Added commas    v  v
  `((+ ,a ,b) is ,(+ ,a ,b)))
;; Error:
;; Comma not inside a backquote.

;;   Stream: #&lt;dynamic-extent STRING-INPUT-STREAM (unavailable) from "(let ((a..."&gt;
;;    [Condition of type SB-INT:SIMPLE-READER-ERROR]
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If we add the commas to the second<code>a</code> and<code>b</code>, since the outer<code>(+ ...)</code> form is already preceded with a comma, we get that error.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="comma-at-sign-in-backquotes" class="almighty-section-title">Comma At-Sign In Backquotes</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In the<code>when-let</code> macro, we also saw<code>,@body</code>. The<code>,@</code> "splices" the form into the backquoted code--removing the outermost parentheses.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((a 5)
      (b '(1 2 3))
      (c 9))
  `(+ ,a ,@b ,c))
                                        ; =&gt; (+ 5 1 2 3 9)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>,@</code> is commonly used with macros that take an arbitrary number of arguments and passing those arguments along to another form that also takes an arbitrary number of arguments. That's what the<code>body</code> parameter for<code>when-let</code> is.</p>

</article>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="back-to-when-let" class="almighty-section-title">Back to =when-let=</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Getting back to constructing a macro, after having the call and expansion prepared, you need to look at the parts that are common between them, and then make those parameters in the<code>defmacro</code> lambda-list.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For example, look at<code>user</code>. It's in the expansion code three times:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((user ...))
 (... user
   (... user))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">and in the macro call twice:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(when-let (user ...)
  (... user))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Which means a parameter in the<code>when-let</code> definition needs to correspond to this variable.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro when-let ((var ...)...)
  ...)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">...and any instance of<code>var</code> in the body of the macro definition needs to be preceded with a comma.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro when-let ((var ...)...)
  `(let ((,var ...))
     (when ,var
       ...)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The same goes for<code>(get-user id)</code>. It appears once in the expansion and once in the macro call.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((... (get-user id)))
 (... ...
   (... ...)))

(when-let (... (get-user id))
  ...)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So it gets a spot in the parameter list of the macro:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro when-let ((... expression) ...)
  ...)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And where<code>expression</code> appears in the macro body, it's preceded with a comma.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro when-let ((... expression) ...)
  `(let ((... ,expression))
     ...))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The calls to<code>(welcome-message user)</code> and<code>(redirect-to-dashboard user)</code> are actually in a space where we expect any arbitrary number of arbitrary forms. For that, we use a<code>&amp;body</code> parameter and splice it in with<code>,@</code>.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro when-let ((... ...) &amp;body body)
  `(let ((... ...))
     (when ...
       ,@body)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Altogether:</p>

<h3 id="destructuring-arbitrary-list-structures-in-parameters" class="almighty-section-title">Destructuring Arbitrary List Structures In Parameters</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In the example of<code>when-let</code>, we saw something strange in the lambda-list:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">;;                  v              v
(defmacro when-let ((var expression) &amp;body body)
  ...)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">What's going on there?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Macros can take any list structure as a parameter and destructure them--binding parameters to elements within the list passed to the macro. To understand this characteristic of macro parameters, first we need to understand destructuring, represented best by<code>destructuring-bind</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>destructuring-bind</code> takes an arbitrary list structure and binds the elements of the list to local variables.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((people '(("Micah" 40 ("Lisp" "Hiking" "Photography"))
                ("Guy" 71 ("Engineering" "Frogs" "Education"))
                ("Joe" 50 ("Games" "Civilization" "Finding Good Women")))))
  (dolist (person people)
    (destructuring-bind (name age (interest1 interest2 interest3)) person
      (print interest1))))
                                        ; "Lisp" 
                                        ; "Engineering" 
                                        ; "Games"  =&gt; NIL
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The first argument to<code>destructuring-bind</code> is a lambda-list of the variables to bind. The key is that it can bind any arbitrary element in any arbitrary list structure directly. All you need to do is mimic the structure of the list in the parameter list to<code>destructuring-bind</code>.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((tree '(1 (2 (3 4) 5 ((6 ((7))))))))
  (destructuring-bind (a (b (c d) e ((f ((g)))))) tree
    (format t "~a + ~a = ~a" d f (+ d f))))
                                        ; 4 + 6 = 10 =&gt; NIL
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Macros can similarly destructure lists in their parameters list:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro add-elements ((a (b (c))))
  (+ a b c))

(add-elements (1 (2 (3))))
                                        ; =&gt; 6 (3 bits, #x6, #o6, #b110)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's important to remember that we didn't call<code>(add-elements '(1 (2 (3)))</code> or<code>(add-elements (list 1 (2 (3)))</code>: those are both single elements. With a function, this would be an invalid call because the 3 (the innermost element) would be interpreted as a function-name, the Lisp evaluator would look for it, and not find it.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, macros have the previous macro expansion/compilation step, so the form<code>(1 (2 (3)))</code> is valid: the macro would be expanded<i>before</i> the elements are evaluated.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The<code>setf</code> macro looks at the arguments it receives and decides how to expand based on what it gets.

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It does this without evaluating the expressions passed to it--it only knows the literal representations of the forms. The code is the data it works with. If you need to transform code based on the shape of its inputs, you might need a macro.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The simplest example of a macro that's vulnerable to variable capture is a macro that returns a free variable.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro might-get-captured1 ()
  '(+ x 1))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Why is this macro vulnerable? Because it doesn't return<code>'(+ x 1)</code>. It<i>expands into</i> <code>(+ x 1)</code>, which is then evaluated at runtime.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(might-get-captured1) ; =&gt; Error: The variable X is unbound.
(let ((x 1))
  (might-get-captured1))
                                        ; =&gt; 2 (2 bits, #x2, #o2, #b10)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Try expanding the code with<code>SPC m m</code> (<code>macrostep-expand</code>) to verify.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Compare to a function:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun cant-capture-me ()
  '(+ x 1))
(cant-capture-me)
                                        ; =&gt; (+ X 1)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So it's important to remember that quotes/backquotes in functions return literal representations, whereas macros use quotes/backquotes as templates for expanding into code-to-be-evaluated.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In addition to macros with free variables, macros that bind multiple variables within one<code>let</code> are also vulnerable to capture. Consider the following macro:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmacro might-get-captured2 (variable)
  `(let ((x 1)
         (,variable 0))
     (values x ,variable)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If we call it like this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((y 5))
  (might-get-captured2 y))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">What do you expect the return values to be?</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((y 5))
  (might-get-captured2 y))
                                        ; =&gt; 1, 0
;; Expanded
(let ((y 5))
  (let ((x 1) (y 0))
    (values x y)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Or what about this wombo combo:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((x 5))
  (might-get-captured2 x))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">What is the return value? It's an error because<code>x</code> occurs twice in the expanded<code>let</code> form.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">;; Expanded

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To some extent, simply following the more modern One-Package-Per-File convention for factoring projects can also prevent some instances of variable capture. If you have<code>my-macro</code> with symbol<code>x</code> inside it, if someone uses<code>my-macro</code> in their own package with an<code>x</code> symbol, they will actually be two different symbols:<code>my-macro-package::x</code> and<code>their-package::x</code>.</p>

<h4 id="use-gensym" class="almighty-section-title">Use =gensym=</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Even if you give variables different names, and even if you give them names that others are unlikely to use, you have no guarantees that they will<i>never</i> be used by users of your macro.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Instead, you can create<i>anonymous symbols</i> with<code>gensym</code>.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(gensym)

</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Every time you call<code>gensym</code>, it will generate a symbol with a unique name.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Above, we expanded several different calls to<code>setf</code> to show how it transforms based on the data it's passed. When we passed it<code>(vehicle-color *cruiser*)</code>, it expanded into this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let* ((#:*cruiser*575 *cruiser*) (#:new574 "White"))
  (funcall #'(setf vehicle-color) #:new574 #:*cruiser*575))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can see the variables generated by<code>gensym</code>:<code>#:*cruiser*575</code> and<code>#:new574</code>. By default, symbols generated with<code>gensym</code> are prefixed with<code>G</code>, but we can change that:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(gensym "*CRUISER*")
                                        ; =&gt; #:*CRUISER*592
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We can even change the suffix number (usually derived from<code>*gensym-counter*</code>) if we pass an integer.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(gensym 500)
                                        ; =&gt; #:G500
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Importantly, these anonymous symbols aren't interned, so you can't even find them if you go searching.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(find-symbol "*CRUISER*592" )
                                        ; =&gt; NIL, NIL
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And in fact, even if they appear to have the same name, two symbols generated with<code>gensyms</code> are still entirely different objects in memory.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(let ((a (gensym 100))
      (b (gensym 100)))

</code></pre>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Once you find a variable that can possibly be captured, saving it to an anonymous symbol is a bulletproof way to avoid capture.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Why? Because the<code>defun</code> special operator is actually a<i>macro</i> whose first argument is a name for the function you are defining.

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, because we didn't<code>:use #:cl</code>,<code>defun</code> is interpreted as the name of a<i>function</i>, which requires first that all inner forms be evaluated and their values returned. And since<code>hello-world</code> isn't bound to any value yet, we get the above error.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Common Lisp system are what other languages might call "packages".</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">A project may have code organized across many different files. In order to call code from one file in another file, you will need to have that file loaded into your Lisp image. If<code>core.lisp</code> calls and relies on<code>utils.lisp</code> code, then<code>utils.lisp</code> code needs to be loaded before<code>core.lisp</code> is loaded and run. If you have a lot of files that need to be loaded in a particular order, you probably want a way to automate this process. Systems, defined with<code>defsystem</code> and the<code>ASDF</code> library, are declarations of groups of code loaded in a particular order.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you need to coordinate the loading of multiple files, including third-party systems, then it's time to think about your<code>defsystem</code>.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="what-is-asdf" class="almighty-section-title">What Is ASDF?</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">ASDF is the defacto-standard library (available out of the box with SBCL and other implementations) that adds convenient code loading orchestration capabilities to Lisp. You do so by defining a<code>defsystem</code> in a<code>.asd</code> file in your project's root directory and then loading the system. When you load the system, ASDF will load your other files depending on your system definition.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Because<code>defsystem</code> is a third-party extension to Lisp and was not previously available, there are different styles of organizing packages and systems in older projects that are less common in more modern projects. We'll be taking a look at different styles of factoring later, but for now let's focus on<code>defsystem</code> alone.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>:nicknames</code> defines what other package name qualifiers you can use besides<code>hunchentoot</code>. That means that Hunchentoot itself provides you the ability to use<code>(tbnl:*acceptor*)</code> if you want. Useful for allowing users to use a smaller package name qualifier on their symbols.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Hunchentoot uses<code>:use</code> for several utility libraries. Again, I don't recommend it, but it is not uncommon.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>:shadow</code> here creates an symbol or symbols that are initially unbound in the package. Clearly, there was a naming conflict somewhere between Common Lisp's built-in<code>defconstant</code> and the<code>url-encode</code> symbol intended to have two different values (<code>utils.lisp</code> and<code>url-rewrite/url-rewrite.lisp</code> both define<code>url-encode</code> functions). What this means is that in the<code>hunchentoot</code> package, if you write<code>url-encode</code> while you are in the<code>hunchentoot</code> package, it has a different value than if you are in the<code>url-rewrite</code> package.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's a wonky way of preventing a naming conflict error because the<code>hunchentoot</code> package<i>uses</i> <code>:url-rewrite</code> instead of importing it. However, you might sometimes need to use<code>:shadow</code> to get around naming conflicts caused by other systems/libraries that use Common Lisp symbol names, so it's something to keep in mind.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The important point is this: All of the files in the project root begin with<code>(in-package :hunchentoot)</code>. Each file contributes their defined symbols to the<code>:hunchentoot</code> package.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If all this package talk has the ol' nogging working overtime, you might be thinking, "Hey Micah, doesn't that assume that the<code>packages.lisp</code> file is loaded before all the others?"</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Notice<code>:serial t</code> up at the top. That means that all of the<code>:components</code> will be loaded<i>in the order they are listed</i>. So, after all of the<code>:depends-on</code> dependency systems are loaded, the<code>url-rewrite</code> module will be loaded. Its contents will also be loaded in order, and so first the<code>url-rewrite/packages.lisp</code> file will be loaded, then<code>specials.lisp</code>,<code>primitives.lisp</code>, etc. After that module is loaded, the first file in the project root that will be loaded is its<code>packages.lisp</code> file that we look at before. The Mother Of All<code>packages.lisp</code> is where all the symbols for the majority of the project live and are namespaced.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are only two other systems in the Hunchentoot project: one for development and the other for testing. They don't provide any further insight into this strategy, so we will skip them.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In summary, the Mother Of All Package Strategy is this: you have one package (<code>defpackage :hunchentoot</code>) and one system (<code>defsystem :hunchentoot</code>), and that one package<code>:uses</code> or imports from several other packages. Other code files begin with<code>(in-package :hunchentoot)</code>, giving them access to the symbols defined in other files and contributing the symbols they define to that package. The<code>packages.lisp</code> file's exports define the public interface for users. This style is "retro", but still perfectly usable especially on smaller projects, and even larger projects like Hunchentoot. The<code>vend</code> library is a modern Lisp library that use this Mother of All Package Strategy.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Instead of<code>defpackage</code>, Mito uses UIOP's<code>define-package</code> macro. It uses it because it provides a new option,<code>:use-reexport</code>. It's like<code>:use</code>, but with two important differences:</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It will import all of the<i>exported</i> symbols of the packages that are passed as arguments, and then<i>reexport them</i>.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If there is a naming conflict between symbols in the packages passed in the form,<i>the first one takes precedence</i>, shadowing versions that come later. That means that if there is a<code>mito.core:cool-symbol</code> and a<code>mito.migration:cool-symbol</code>, because<code>mito.core</code> comes first in the above definition, the<code>mito</code> package with inherit<code>mito.core:cool-symbol</code> and then that version will be reexported.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In systems like Mito, the<code>reexport</code> options (<code>:reexport</code>,<code>:use-reexport</code>, and<code>:mix-reexport</code>) are used to help easily "bubble up" exports from peripheral packages into one final public API.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, although Mito bubbles up dependencies with<code>:depends-on</code>, using the One Package Per File Strategy doesn't preclude using<code>:serial t</code>, either.</p>

<h3 id="one-system-per-package" class="almighty-section-title">One System Per Package</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There is one other strategy worth noting. It's perhaps best represented by the<code>utopian</code> web framework. Let's take a look at its system definition:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

</figure>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The first thing you'll notice is that the definition is short. The dependencies only include...another file in the system? And there are no<code>:components</code>! To investigate, let's look in the "utopian/main"... file? Package? System?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's found in<code>src/main.lisp</code>:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We already saw<code>:nicknames</code> in the Hunchentoot<code>packages.lisp</code> file.<code>:mix-reexport</code> is like<code>:use-reexport</code> that we saw in Mito, except that it will inherit<i>all</i> symbols, exported and not, from the packages that follow into the current package. Every single symbol from those six packages above are going to be inherited into the<code>#:utopian</code> package.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But now you may be wondering, "How do they get loaded if the system file doesn't list them in<code>:components</code>?"</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">That's not all, friends. The mystery deepens when we look in the<code>utopian/routes</code> package file:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Wait, there is a third-party library--<code>myway</code>--imported in this package! That wasn't in the system definition!</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">That one line drastically changes how packages and systems work.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><b>All packages in a<code>:package-inferred-system</code> are treated as entire systems themselves</b>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Package inferred systems will all have an entry-point into the system, like<code>:depends-on ("utopian/main")</code>. Remember: up until now, dependencies were systems. We were confused because<code>:utopian</code> is a<i>package</i>, not a<i>system</i>. But because of<code>:package-inferred-system</code>,<code>:utopian</code> and all of its dependent packages are treated like their own systems by ASDF! That's why the files for the rest of the project aren't listed in<code>:depends-on</code>:<code>utopian/main</code> is treated like a system, where its prerequisite packages are as well. ASDF will do the work of resolving the dependencies, hence why you don't need to list them manually. It will<code>load</code> prerequisite packages/systems both in the<code>utopian</code> project,<b>including third-party libraries</b>, downloading them if necessary.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Package inferred systems are the Package Per File taken to its limit: System Per File.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Using package inferred systems requires following a few rules which I'll demonstrate.</p>

<h2 id="the-great-debate-package-system-best-practices" class="almighty-section-title">The Great Debate: Package & System Best Practices</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">As a newcomer to Lisp, you might want to be able to fit in with the broader ecosystem. You want to learn the idioms and patterns common to Lisp users, private and professional. So even if you're a sophisticated senior who knows that "it depends" is probably the answer, you still ask the question, "Which strategy is should I choose? Which one's the best?"</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="argument-in-favor-of-pis" class="almighty-section-title">Argument in Favor of PIS</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The architect of ASDF wrote<a href="https://github.com/fare/asdf/blob/master/doc/best_practices.md">a document</a> precisely to answer this question. Unfortunately, it leaves more questions than answers. First, it explains problems with the other strategies we've covered:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you start writing large enough systems, putting everything in one big package leads to a big mess: it's hard to find what function is defined where, or should be defined where; you invent your own symbol prefixing system to avoid name clashes; totally unrelated things end up in the same mother-of-all package; you divide your mother-of-all package into a few subpackages, but as the software keeps growing each of these packages in turn becomes too big.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Meanwhile, as you grow large enough libraries, you find that you loading a big library just to use a small part of it becomes a big hassle, leading to code bloat, too much recompilation, too much re-testing, and not enough understanding of what's going on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So the problems with the Mother Of All Package Strategy are:</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Naming conflicts.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Hard to understand.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">A hassle to load and recompile.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We saw with Hunchentoot that "shadowing" of symbols was a little hard to understand, yet appears to be the solution to naming conflicts in a project factored as it is. If you have files using symbol names found in other files in project, it can be hard to understand which symbol's value is the<i>actual</i> value used in the overall package. Thus, you namespace using some sort of naming convention.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Additionally, you might try dividing into some sub-packages, but it's somewhat arbitrary, meaning developers have to come up with their own coding conventions regarding package management. Whether you use one package or multiple, if your system is large enough, those strategies will ultimately cause trouble.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">After explaining how Package Inferred Systems work, he explains how they solve the above problems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This allows for large modular libraries, wherein you may use one file, and only that file and its transitive dependencies will be loaded, rather than the entire humongous library.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This also helps you enforce a discipline wherein it is always clear in which file each symbol is defined, which files have symbols used by any other file, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In<a href="https://x.com/almighty_lisp/status/1938416300826759368?s=20">a discussion I had with the author on X</a>, our friend François-René Rideau (or<a href="https://github.com/fare">fare on Github</a>), I asked about the rationale behind PIS, why it is the best practice, etc. He said that the motivation to create PIS was to help large teams, but he also said that PIS can be useful for individuals with large or ambitious projects. He said that large .asd files (remember Mito's system?) tend to be error-prone. Further, he says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">[In large .asd files] you often leave a lot of obsolete dependencies that slow the build and the understanding of the code by newcomers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So large system definitions are scary to mess with, making it safer and therefore more likely for teams to leave unused dependencies in the system. That can make understanding the code more difficult, and make builds unnecessarily slower.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">While ultimately he didn't make a conclusive recommendation to use PIS, he appears to prefer using PIS from the beginning to improve modularity and understandability of code, and to make coordination with other developers easier.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="arguments-against-pis" class="almighty-section-title">Arguments Against PIS</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So the argument in favor of Package Inferred Systems boils down to this:</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It helps reduce problems of coordination with other developers.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It helps make the code more understandable.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It helps reduce the amount of unnecessary code that remains in the project.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The question is: Does it really do all those things? And are PIS more effective than the alternatives?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Understanding packages and systems is one of the more challenging things about learning Common Lisp for newcomers. That's why I've gone into more detail here on the subject than I have with other language features.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Before I make my counter-argument to PIS, I must emphasize that I have no professional experience with Common Lisp, nor have I written any large projects with it. Fare, on the other hand, is an accomplished Lisper with experience writing Lisp in large teams. The odds that I am not understanding the benefits of PIS because of a lack of experience are astronomically high. I make my counter-arguments with fear and trepidation in my heart. All I have to guide me are my small brain and an intuition--as limited as it may be--about how simple programs and programming should be.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">My experience of package inferred systems is that they actually led to<i>more</i> confusion, not less. Perhaps you felt it too as we took our journey through these different strategies.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Hunchentoot listed all third-party dependencies in the system definition--thus you had a sense of what code you needed to download, and what your potential exposure to bugs or security problems was. The<code>defsystem</code> used the<code>:serial t</code> option to let you, the newcomer, know that all of the<code>:component</code> files were loaded in the order they were listed. The Mother Of All<code>packages.lisp</code> gave us an easy to read overview of the public API. Without any sophisticated knowledge or tools, the code was understandable (with perhaps the exception of the use of<code>:shadow</code> for a couple of symbols).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Was it always that way? How many challenges did the project have with coordination or understandability before it reached the point where we saw it? How much unseen discipline was practiced in the naming and organization of symbols in the project? For example, perhaps it was difficult to organize and line up the files in the<code>defsystem</code> definition so that all of the right code was loaded in the correct order? Is the project bloated? We see only a snapshot of the project as it is now. We can't know the challenges of coordination, dependency management, and code factoring that had to be overcome just from looking at the source.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, when we look at the source, the design of the system is undeniably<i>simple</i> and<i>easy to understand</i>, even for a dummy newcomer like me.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The same is true of the<code>vend</code> library, which uses a similar strategy.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>mito</code>, on the other hand, has a somewhat more difficult to follow<code>defsystem</code>: the liberal use of<code>:depends-on</code> and the inversion of the dependency tree makes the system definition much more difficult to follow. The system has several subsystems, and some of the packages use options like<code>:use-reexport</code> and so-on. You need to have a deeper understanding of how systems work, how shadowing works, and how those package options will effect the final shape of the system. While Hunchentoot was fairly transparent, Mito's system architecture introduced a fair bit of noisy abstractions that make reasoning about the system difficult at a glance.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But perhaps with experience I would see the value in the abstractions? Perhaps the alternative would have been noisier, more difficult to extend with other developers, and more bloated?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And then there's<code>utopian</code> and<code>:package-inferred-system</code>. The .asd file is small, but that just left us more questions than answers. Chief among them is: how many dependencies does it have, and where do they come from? What does the final public API actually look like after all subsystem symbols are bubbled up to the top system? What code is loaded (and potentially executed), and when?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">About API discoverability, Fare said the following in our discussion on X:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The SLIME REPL, not the unaided source code, is how you discover the code. Plus the generated documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This is an important point: Great tools can make a developer's job easier. That's why one of the goals of this book is to help you understand all of the tools available to you in Emacs. If you code Common Lisp in Emacs without knowing about window management, REPL shortcuts, SLY debugger restarts/keybindings,<code>evil-mode</code> VIM keybindings, etc. you are missing out on a great number of very powerful tools for efficient and pleasant coding.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, I disagree with Fare about how code is discovered. Yes, we can type<code>SPC m g d</code> or<code>g d</code> to use<code>sly-edit-definition</code> to go to the definition of some symbol. Yes, we can look at the documentation. But none of those provide a clear overview of third-party dependencies of the project nor a clear view of the shape of the system as a whole. Tools like PIS blur our vision of the whole system. When I look at projects that use those tools, every bone in my body screams, "Complexity spirit demon."</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Unfortunately, I am not the only one that feels this way. Do a search for "package-inferred-system" on X and you'll find a lot of confusion or even distaste for it.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Still, there are some notable people that really enjoy it. The most well-known users are probably the<a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/">Eitaro Fukamachi (https://github.com/fukamachi)</a> (author of<code>mito</code> and many other libraries) and<a href="https://github.com/svetlyak40wt">Alexander Artemenko (https://github.com/svetlyak40wt)</a>--the man behind<a href="https://github.com/40ants">40ants (https://github.com/40ants)</a> and Ultralisp--both of whom are prolific giants in the Common Lisp community (I think I'm starting to sweat here). Alexander has explained why he likes PIS<a href="https://x.com/svetlyak40wt/status/1179260459255549952?s=20">on X</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For me this more important consequence is that I have not to figure out dependencies between files anymore and to hardcode them in the *.asd files. System definition can be just: (defsystem "foo" :class :package-inferred-system :depends-on ("foo/main"))</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This echos what Fare says about system understandability and ease of code factoring. So maybe there is something to the arguments about the challenges of factoring that standard<code>defsystem</code> definitions impose.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">My brain may not be big enough to understand the ease-of-use and ease-of-understanding arguments. There's a good chance it's a skill issue.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">However, there is one feature of PIS that unfortunately I can't forgive, no matter how small my brain.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The fact that third-party dependencies are not defined in the .asd file, but instead are spread across the codebase, is simply not acceptable. As an Almighty Lisp programmer, dependency management needs to be crystal clear both for understanding and for containment. Package inferred systems simply make it too easy to introduce dependencies in unknown places. My goal is the keep my use of dependencies limited, decreasing my dependencies over time. If it's easy to add and forget about them, then the temptation to increase my dependencies will be too great.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The community doesn't appear to view PIS as the way forward. Community adoption of PIS is very low. Package inferred systems have been around since 2014, more than 10 years ago. At present, while there are nearly 5000 systems available on the Quicklisp repository, only around 60 unique systems use<code>:package-inferred-system</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">LEM--an Emacs clone written from scratch in Common Lisp--and Coalton--a new Lisp language implementing a Haskell-like type system--are among the largest and most ambitious publicly available projects. Neither use PIS. Both use the<code>:serial t</code> option for the<code>:components</code>, manually listing dependencies and files to load from the project. Both make heavy use of the One Package Per File Strategy, but LEM also uses a hybrid Mother Of All Package. Coalton provides a public API in a<code>package.lisp</code> file! In fact, Coalton uses a strategy similar to Fare's<code>LIL</code> library--providing a<code>package.lisp</code> file for smaller "modules" in the system (modules by convention) and reexporting the symbols from the module files, allowing the system to bubble up symbols to the top level packages.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="conclusion" class="almighty-section-title">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So to answer the question, "Is it essential to learn and use package inferred systems?", the answer is<b>No</b>. For small projects, a Mother Of All package can work fine, but the most common approach on modern projects by far is One Package Per File with some strategy for bubbling up and potentially listing exported symbols into a final API.</p>

<h2 id="quicklisp" class="almighty-section-title">QUICKLISP</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There is a surprising amount of open source code available for Lisp. The most common way to obtain it is through<code>quicklisp</code>, the defacto-standard library manager for Lisp. As I said before, ASDF by default uses quicklisp to download systems defined in the<code>:depends-on</code> portion of the<code>defsystem</code> if no local copy exists (in the<code>~/quicklisp</code> folder). When you want third-party libraries, you will likely begin by using quicklisp.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="using-quicklisp" class="almighty-section-title">Using Quicklisp</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Using quicklisp is simple. Let's say you want to load the<code>local-time</code> system. To do that:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(ql:quickload "local-time")
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you don't already have<code>local-time</code> in your<code>~/quicklisp</code> folder, quicklisp will download it from the quicklisp repository. After downloading it, it will then load the system as if you had run<code>asdf:load-system</code>. To text it, try running<code>(local-time:now)</code> in the REPL.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="local-code" class="almighty-section-title">Local Code</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Quicklisp will download and load code from the<code>quicklisp</code> "dist". What if you want to load your own local code? How do you create your own library that you can add to a<code>.asd</code> file and load seamlessly like any other library?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To do that with Quicklisp, you can add code to either the<code>~/common-lisp</code> or<code>~/quicklisp/local-projects</code> folders.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">I've personally had trouble with Quicklisp loading code from these folders, rather than the code I've vendored (using<code>vend</code>, introduced below). As a result, I don't like using either of these folders, but you might have better results than I did.</p>

<h2 id="ultralisp" class="almighty-section-title">ULTRALISP</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Quicklisp is a repository that is only infrequently updated (by one guy). As a result, you might not be able to get the latest version of a project, or it may never be available at all on Quicklisp.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">An alternative to Quicklisp is<code>ultralisp</code>. Ultralisp is a "dist" that is installed on Quicklisp (which has its own default "dist" named<code>quicklisp</code>) and that is updated every five minutes. If you go to<a href="https://ultralisp.org">https://ultralisp.org</a> you can get instructions on how to install and use it. I haven't ever used it, so I can't give my opinion one way or the other.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In passing, I've seen people have trouble using Ultralisp because they may inadvertently install different versions of the same library and getting Quicklisp (the library manager, not the dist) to load one or the other can be a bit troublesome. This might be similar to the problems I've had with using local code with Quicklisp as I explained above.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h2 id="qlot" class="almighty-section-title">QLOT</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>Qlot</code> is an alternative library dependency library, found at<a href="https://qlot.tech/">https://qlot.tech/</a>. It is designed to essentially solve "versioning" problems above. It allows you to pin your dependencies to certain versions of libraries--as found on the Quicklisp "dist".</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Qlot is worthy of taking a closer look at. It includes useful command-line commands and library dependencies are defined in separate<code>qlfile</code> and<code>qlfile.lock</code> files, making it feel a bit more familiar to library management systems found in other ecosystems.

<h2 id="ocicl" class="almighty-section-title">OCICL</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>ocicl</code> is another alternative to Quicklisp that does more than just package management. It also does linting and has project scaffolding capabilities. It's developed by a programmer at Red Hat. It's Github page states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The main innovation behind ocicl is the idea of applying the ecosystem of tooling and services from the world of application container images to ordinary tarballs of Lisp code. In essence, OCI + CL = ocicl.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you know what it means for software to be packaged as "OCI-compliant artifacts", you might find ocicl of interest. I'm not sophisticated enough to understand the value proposition, so I've never used it.</p>

<h2 id="vend" class="almighty-section-title">VEND</h2>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>vend</code> (<a href="https://github.com/fosskers/vend">https://github.com/fosskers/vend</a>) is my preferred alternative to Quicklisp. The vend philosophy is this: vendor dependencies, and make that simple.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Unlike the other alternatives above, it makes no use of either Quicklisp the tool or the "dist". Instead, it downloads dependencies directly from git repositories. It has its own repository--just a list of libraries and their git repo link.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The marketing copy from the<code>vend</code> Github readme states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Why vend?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Dependency management in Common Lisp has traditionally centred around Quicklisp. A desire for access to more rapid package updates spawned Ultralisp. The need for version pinning and isolation birthed Qlot. The want for a better distribution system brought us ocicl.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But, could there be a simpler paradigm than just downloading the code and putting it right there?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">With vend:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We need not perform bespoke installation scripts to get started.
We need not wait for Quicklisp to update.
We need not relegate all our systems to ~/common-lisp/.
We need not worry about where ASDF is looking for systems.
We need not fret over tools performing strange internal overrides.
We need not manage extra config files or lockfiles.
Plus, vend is actually an external tool with extra commands to help you inspect and manage your dependencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If we, as almighty developers, want to defeat the machines, we need to consciously seek ways of doing more work in fewer steps. Finding and using the simplest way to do things is a matter of survival. Vend is an important for simplifying our tech stack and empowering us to do more. That's why for projects in the next chapter, we will be using<code>vend</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">I will explain how to install and use<code>vend</code> when it becomes necessary.</p>

<h3 id="introduction" class="almighty-section-title">Introduction</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For this project, we are going to build a simple library for dealing with money.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In our library, money will be an integer with some extras. Money has a currency--USD, JPY, etc.--that both limits how mathematical operations can be conducted on it and how it is displayed. You can add 5 to 5, but you can't add 5 USD into 5 JPY directly. USD is displayed with dollars on the left of a decimal, cents on the right: $10.52. 1000 USD is displayed with a comma after the 1: $1,000. This is true of every fourth digit--counting from right to left on the dollars side. USD uses the $ sign, and it's placed at the beginning of the number.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The functions that will be implemented for this library are simple:<code>money+</code>,<code>money-</code>,<code>money*</code>,<code>money/</code>,<code>money=</code>,<code>money&gt;</code>, and<code>money&lt;</code>. We won't be doing any currency conversion here; we just want a way to do simple math on numbers that are a little special.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We will use Common Lisp's hash-tables and OOP facilities to make our library extensible: I don't know how to display whatever the currency is in India or Transylvania, but we'll make it easy for someone from there to add support for those currencies without modifying our code.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The necessary functionality is basic, so our use of hash-tables and OOP will also only be the basics.</p>

<h3 id="a-money-type" class="almighty-section-title">A =money= type</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Let's say that we have two numbers, 5000 and 3000. We want to add those numbers, but there's a catch: we need to know that they are the same<i>type</i> of number. If we are putting $5,000 and ¥3,000 into our wallet, we want to keep them separate. 7/11 in Japan doesn't want our dollars, and 7/11 in the US doesn't want our yen, so we can't mix them all willy nilly. We need to keep them separate and treat them as two entirely different<i>types</i> of money.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In Common Lisp, to create a new type, we use<code>defclass</code>. So let's create a<code>money</code> type:</p>

<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defclass money ()
  ((amount :initarg :amount :initform 0 :accessor amount)
   (currency-code :initarg :currency-code :initform nil :accessor currency-code)
   (currency-sign :initarg :currency-sign :initform nil :accessor currency-sign))
  (:documentation "A class that holds all the information about some money. Any
 class that inherits from the MONEY class must provide a default CURRENCY-CODE
 and CURRENCY-SIGN.

AMOUNT is an integer. Ex. 1000000. This value reflects the smallest monetary
unit for each currency. A MONEY object with AMOUNT 5000 and CURRENCY-CODE USD
means $50.00, or 5,000 cents.

CURRENCY-CODE is a string using the ISO 4217 format. Ex. \"USD\"

CURRENCY-SIGN is a string. It is some symbol to represent the type of money
being displayed. Ex. \"$\""))
</code></pre>
</figure>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We could add<code>:type</code> specifications to each of the slots, but how the compiler enforces the types is<i>implementation dependent</i>. That means we can't be sure if, how, or under what conditions our implementation will enforce those types.<code>:type</code> might be useful under certain circumstances (and perhaps the mere value of defining<code>:type</code> as documentation is useful to you), but for now we'll keep things simple.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The ~amount= slot is an integer, and it represents the smallest monetary unit for its currency. That means that 5000 USD is $50.00 and 5000 JPY is ¥5,000.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="making-money" class="almighty-section-title">Making money</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Now, let's try making some money:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We now see one of the downsides of using OOP: the representation of the<code>money</code> object in the REPL is unhelpful. We will fix DX problems like that later. For now, let's define a<code>make-money</code> function to make the code a bit less verbose:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun make-money (&amp;optional (amount 0) (currency *default-currency*))
  (assert (and (integerp amount)) (amount)

  (etypecase currency
    (money (make-instance (type-of currency) :amount amount))
    (string (make-instance (get-registered-currency currency) :amount amount))
    (symbol (make-instance currency :amount amount))))

(let ((50-bucks (make-money 50)))
  (list (amount 50-bucks) (currency-code 50-bucks) (currency-sign 50-bucks)))
                                        ; =&gt; (50 "USD" "$")
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For the<code>currency</code> argument,<code>make-money</code> can take either another<code>money</code> object, a string like "USD", or a symbol like<code>'us-dollar</code>. Internally, we'll be sending<code>money</code> objects or using symbols, but users of the library might prefer to just use currency codes instead without importing the<code>defclass</code> of their desired currency everywhere they want to use<code>make-money</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Our system for registering and looking up currencies is simple: We use a hash-table to store and look up currency classes by currency code.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defparameter *default-currency* "USD")

<h3 id="adding-money" class="almighty-section-title">Adding money</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The core purpose of this library is this: ensure that only money of the same currency is combined or compared mathematically. That means that the implementation of the<code>money+</code> function is going to be simple:</p>

      (make-money total expected-currency))))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>money+</code> takes an arbitrary number of arguments. We check each argument with<code>dolist</code>: in the case where<code>current-currency</code> is of type<code>money</code> and the currencies of<code>expected-currency</code> and<code>current-currency</code> match, we add its ~amount= to<code>total</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">This function only takes<code>money</code> objects. We try to detect non-money objects early by checking if the first argument is<code>moneyp</code>, but<code>etypecase</code> takes care of the rest.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If the currencies of the expected and current currency don't match, then<code>money+</code> signals a<code>mismatched-currencies</code> condition.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's not strictly necessary to make a condition. We could just use a simple<code>error</code>:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Having a custom condition saves us the trouble of copying the same error in several later functions; convenient but no big deal.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The real utility is allowing us (sometime later in a different library) or others (in their own application code) to act specifically on this condition. We aren't going to implement currency conversion functionality in this library, but we or others might want to be able to make a currency conversion when currencies are mismatched. Or maybe that would be a silly idea. I don't know, but I'm leaving that up to the next guy to decide. With a tiny bit of effort, I can provide myself and others that flexibility.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="improving-ergonomics" class="almighty-section-title">Improving Ergonomics</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And that's it: the critical functionality of our library is complete. However, we really should improve the ergonomics a bit. When we print a<code>money</code> object, it looks like this:</p>
<pre class="example" id="orgcb06271">
#&lt;USD {7006D80343}&gt;
</pre>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">What we really want is for it to look like this:</p>
<pre class="example" id="org32bce68">
#&lt;USD 5000&gt;
</pre>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We do that with the<code>print-object</code> generic function. We can change how an object is printed by creating a method specialized on our<code>money</code> or<code>us-dollar</code> types.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmethod print-object ((this money) stream)
  (print-unreadable-object (this stream)
    (format stream "MONEY ~a ~a" (slot-value this 'amount) (slot-value this 'currency-code))))

  (print-unreadable-object (this stream)
    (format stream "~a ~a" (slot-value this 'currency-code) (slot-value this 'amount))))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The<code>print-unreadable-object</code> function needs some explanation. When you return an object in the REPL, you can highlight it with the cursor and type<code>Enter</code> or left-click it with your mouse to<code>inspect</code> the object. This default behavior is preserved for<code>print-object</code> methods that you specialize on classes you define if you wrap the call to<code>format</code> in<code>print-unreadable-object</code>.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="formatting-for-human-consumption" class="almighty-section-title">Formatting for Human Consumption</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">One last important job for our library will be displaying the money amount as normal people expect money amounts to be displayed. That means that<code>#&lt;USD 5000&gt;</code> needs to be formatted as $50.00 and<code>#&lt;JPY 5000&gt;</code> needs to be formatted as<code>¥5,000</code>. We want one function to be able to format any currency properly. We could have one function with a big<code>cond</code> do that:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun format-money (money-obj)

        ((gbpp money-obj) (format-gbp money-obj))
        ...))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But that has the one downside that it requires updating this one function any time we want to add support for a currency to the library. It's not a huge burden, it's true, and some people may even prefer it. However, Common Lisp has an OOP solution to make our code more extensible: generic functions.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defgeneric format-money (stream currency)
  (:documentation "A generic function that takes a currency object and formats it in for human
consumption."))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Then we need to make a generic<i>method</i> to format USD:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defmethod format-money (stream (this us-dollar))
  (let ((total-cents (amount this)))
    (cond ((&lt; total-cents 0)
           (let* ((total-cents (- total-cents))
                  (dollars (floor total-cents 100))
                  (cents (mod total-cents 100)))
             (format stream "-~a~:D.~2,'0D" (currency-sign this) dollars cents)))
          (t
           (let ((dollars (floor total-cents 100))
                 (cents (mod total-cents 100)))
             (format stream "~a~:D.~2,'0D" (currency-sign this) dollars cents))))))
</code></pre>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For small, negative values of<code>total-cents</code>,<code>floor</code> will be inaccurate (<code>(floor -5 100)</code> will return<code>-1</code> rather than<code>0</code>), so we make all negative integers positive before formatting them, adding the minus-sign back at the beginning of the format string.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>~2,'0D</code> looks crazy, I know. Format directives can be modified by optional parameters--separated by commas--and by modifiers<code>COLON</code> or<code>AT-SIGN</code>. For<code>Tilde D</code>, we have four possible parameters:</p>

<h3 id="adding-currencies" class="almighty-section-title">Adding Currencies</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The library is "complete", in the sense that it does everything we want it to do. One catch: it only works with USD.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">How do we add support for more currencies?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's fairly simple. We'll do it with Japanese Yen:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">;; * JPY
(defclass japanese-yen (money)
  ((currency-code :initform "JPY")
   (currency-sign :initform "¥")))

(register-currency "JPY" 'japanese-yen)

(defmethod format-money (stream (this japanese-yen))
  (format stream "~a~:d" (currency-sign this) (amount this)))

(defmethod print-object ((this japanese-yen) stream)
  (print-unreadable-object (this stream)
    (format stream "~a ~a" (slot-value this 'currency-code) (slot-value this 'amount))))

(defun jpy (amount)
  (assert (integerp amount) (amount)
          "AMOUNT must be an integer, got ~a." amount)
  (make-money amount 'japanese-yen))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We inherit and extend the<code>money</code> class with the<code>japanese-yen</code> class, assigning default values to<code>currency-code</code> and<code>currency-sign</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We register the new currency so that<code>make-money</code> will work properly if called like this:<code>(make-money 5000 "JPY")</code>. It's likely that people will only use<code>jpy</code>, but who knows?</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We specialize the<code>format-money</code> and<code>print-object</code> generic functions with methods for the new<code>japanese-yen</code> type. Formatting Japanese yen is even easier than USD: The lowest and<i>only</i> monetary unit is the yen, so no need for a decimal or the yen equivalent of "cents".</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Then we make a helper-function to make Japanese Yen.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Neither we nor future developers will need to modify any existing code; we use OOP modularity and extensibility that would make every senior Java developer proud.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And thus, our library is complete and ready to be upgraded with support for other currencies in the future.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are five basic types of accounts in an double-entry accounting system: Asset, Expense, Income, Liability, and Equity. All of the accounts are recorded in what's called a Chart of Accounts.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Notice that the value of the balance for the Sales (income/revenue) account increases with credits, but for the COGS (an asset account) the balance increases with debits.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For LHS accounts,<b>credits increase</b> the balance,<b>debits decrease</b> the balance.

<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="balancing-a-transaction" class="almighty-section-title">Balancing a Transaction</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The balance of a transaction is calculated from the debits and credits on two or more accounts in the transaction. A transaction consists of a least one debit and one credit to two separate accounts.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Let's say we are a business that wants to record a cash sale of physical merchandise. A sale will affect that following accounts:</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Inventory (asset)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Cash (asset)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Sales Revenue (income)</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Cost of Goods Sold (COGS, expense)</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Typically, transactions are visualized as a table with a debit and credit column:</p>

<div class="almighty-table-wrapper">
<table class="almighty-book-table"><thead>
<tr>
<th scope="col" class="org-left">Account</th>
<th scope="col" class="org-right">Debit</th>

</div>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So in the table above, cash is debited (increasing in value), sales revenue (an income account) is credited (increasing in value). You now have recorded an increase in your cash-on-hand and your sales.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The Cash of Goods Sold account is debited (increasing in value), and your inventory is credited (decreasing in value). You have paid down the expense you had when purchasing an inventory good and the size or value of your inventory has decreased. By subtracting COGS from Sales Revenue, you can also know how much money you made from the transaction.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">And the debit and credit totals match on both sides.</p>

<h4 id="ledgers" class="almighty-section-title">Ledgers</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Ledgers are ways of viewing the data your system records. For example, a general ledger will show raw data: what transactions occurred. A sales ledger will show sales. An account ledger will show the transactions for an account and its current balance. An accounts payable aging report will show how much money you owe, to whom, and how overdue you might be on a certain account. All of these different ledgers provide insight into your accounting: cash flow, sales/returns, etc.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="dependencies" class="almighty-section-title">Dependencies</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We will be using the<code>almighty-money</code> library we created along with some other dependencies.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Since we are now adding dependencies to our project, I will introduce you to<code>vend</code>, a library that replaces the defacto-standard<code>quicklisp</code> library for dependency management. Let me explain why.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="vendor-your-dependencies" class="almighty-section-title">Vendor Your Dependencies</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The guiding principle of the Almighty Lisp developer is to, above all else, prioritize simplicity. Simplicity is the key to writing code that you and others can maintain without fear or frustration.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When it comes to dependencies, simplicity looks like this:</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Generally avoid adding dependencies to a project unless necessary. If you can write a simple thing yourself that gets the job done, you probably should.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When adding dependencies to your project, adopt them as<b>your code</b>. You are now responsible for their bugs, features, efficiency, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When possible, remove dependencies. Usually this means slowly extracting functionality from a dependency and rewriting it customized for your needs.</p></li>
</ol>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Some people feel that the trend to make dependencies<i>easier</i> to add to a project via tools like<code>npm</code> or<code>uv</code> are detrimental to codebase quality and are a security liability. If adding and maintaining dependencies with such tools is easy, you will be tempted to add and keep large amounts of third-party code in your codebase. Adding a dependency<i>is</i> and<i>should feel</i> like a serious, risky decision.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">While I can see the benefits of that mindset, the Almighty Lisp philosophy is one that is designed to maximize the effectiveness of the<i>individual programmer</i>. If you have a team of developers, you can expect to be able to work together to write the exact code that you need, both your library code and application code. Individual programmers need to prioritize writing application code over library code, which means individuals need to rely more heavily on dependencies.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If your brain is so big you can crank out the whole web stack by yourself while producing high-quality code, you can ignore the above. For the rest of us, we need a simple way of introducing dependencies into our projects that provide us the means to easily transition dependencies into code fit exactly to our purpose, free from the potential of introduced security vulnerabilities.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>vend</code> is a library that does precisely that by making it simple to<i>vendor</i> our dependencies.<code>Vend</code> works by looking at our<code>defsystem</code> definitions, looks at what other systems our system<code>:depends-on</code>, and cloning the requisite systems from github into a directory in our project folder--defaulting to<code>vendored</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If for some reason you don't want to use<code>vend</code>, you can feel free to use<code>quicklisp</code> instead.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h4 id="installing-vend" class="almighty-section-title">Installing =vend=</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Installing<code>vend</code> is simple, but it does have one unusual requirement: it requires ECL, a different implementation of Common Lisp (we installed SBCL at the very beginning, before even installing Emacs). So first, we need to install ECL.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If you're on Linux, you can try looking for a package for your distribution.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">On MacOS, ECL is available on Homebrew.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Otherwise, you can follow the instructions below to compile ECL from the source. These come directly from<a href="https://ecl.common-lisp.dev/static/files/manual/current-manual/Building-ECL.html">the manual</a>.</p>

<h3 id="accounts" class="almighty-section-title">Accounts</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The first thing we need to do is provide a way of designating and knowing whether an account is a left-hand-side account or a right-hand-side account.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Recall that there are five basic categories of account: asset, expense, income, liability, and equity. Recall also that debits and credits influence the value of LHS and RHS differently and use a different formula for calculating their balance. So when we make accounts, we are going to assign it a certain category and we'll need to know which side it is in order to calculate its balance.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">;; * ░ ACCOUNT ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
(defparameter *left-hand-side* '(("asset" -1) ("expense" -1)))
(defparameter *right-hand-side* '(("income" 1) ("liability" 1) ("equity" 1)))
(defparameter *account-types* (append *left-hand-side* *right-hand-side*))

(defun valid-account-category-p (account-category)
    "A predicate that takes an account category string. Returns a list of the
category and its side, or nil."
  (assoc account-category *account-types* :test #'equal))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Just a reminder: the<code>:test #'equal</code> parameter in the call to<code>assoc</code> is necessary because strings are arrays of characters that are instantiated separately. Since the default for<code>:test</code> is<code>#'eql</code>,<code>member</code> usually tests if two things<i>are in identical places in memory</i>.<code>equal</code>, on the other hand, will compare the structure of its inputs.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(eql "hello" "hello") ;; two separately instatiated arrays
                                        ; =&gt; NIL
(let ((str "hello"))
  (eql str str)) ;; same variable, same place in memory

(equal "hello" "hello")
                                        ; =&gt; T
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Next, we define the<code>account</code> table with Mito:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(m:deftable account ()
  ((name :col-type :text)
   (code :col-type :text)
   (category :col-type :text)
   (currency :col-type :text))
  (:table-name "almighty_account")
  (:documentation "A mito macro that defines a class and SQL table for double-entry accounting
accounts."))

(defmethod print-object ((this account) stream)
  (print-unreadable-object (this stream :type t :identity t)
    (with-slots (name code) this
      (format stream "~a ~a" name code))))

(defun side (account)
  "A function for getting the multiplier used for determining whether a
debit/credit increases or decreases the value of an account."
  (second (assoc (account-category account) *account-types* :test #'equal)))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Mito's<code>deftable</code> macro expand into a<code>defclass</code> with a special<code>:meta-class</code>. The slots of the class will all have accessors prefixed with the name of the table. In this case, the accessor for the<code>name</code> slot is<code>account-name</code>. This is similar to how structures work.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The<code>:col-type</code> slot option is for setting the SQL column type. In our case, we are going to use SQLite, which only really has text and integer types. If we were using PostgreSQL, we'd need to be more specific with our<code>:col-types</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">By default Mito will set the SQL table name to the name of the Lisp class (<code>account</code> here), but we can manually set it with the<code>:table-name</code> class option. Here we are namespacing it with the<code>almighty_</code> prefix.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We also define a<code>print-object</code> method for the<code>account</code> class to make it easier to understand when we print account objects to the REPL.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>side</code> will be important for when we enter and retrieve data from the database: it will determine whether the amount entered or returned is negative or positive.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We can manually construct<code>account</code> objects with<code>make-instance</code>, but we'll make a custom constructor for convenience.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defun make-account (name code category &amp;optional (currency am:*default-currency*))

    (error "~a is not a valid account category." category))
  (make-instance 'account :name name :code code :category category :currency currency))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">That also allows us to validate the category.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Because we need to store and retrieve accounts to and from SQL tables, we need some functions for doing that for accounts.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">

</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>save-account</code> is self-explanatory: We don't want duplicate accounts, so we prevent that with<code>save-account</code> by first doing a lookup for the<code>account-code</code> of the account we're trying to create.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>get-or-create-account</code> is useful for times where you want to ensure an account is saved in the database without causing an error if it already exists.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>get-account</code> makes it easy to get an account from a simple string containing an account code.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>define-accessor</code> is a mito macro useful for reducing database hits for things like one-to-many and many-to-many relationship queries. In this case, we have a one-to-many query: getting all the transactions for an account object we pass to it.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For all of these, we used mito and sxql to query our database. Mito provides<code>select-dao</code>, a macro creating a list of Lisp objects containing the queried data. The first argument is a symbol--the name of a table defined with<code>mito:deftable</code>. It acts as the "SELECT * FROM [table-name]" part of a SQL query. You then provide the rest of the query using sxql.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You'll notice that we refer to the<code>transaction</code> table in<code>account-transactions</code>. We'll define that next.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="transactions" class="almighty-section-title">Transactions</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When a transaction is made, such as a sale, a return, a payment, etc. we need to create different parts (what we'll call Legs)--debits and credits--that we need a way to know which parts go together.

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Transactions are simple to implement.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Mito provides the ability to set how a slot "inflates" and "deflates"--serializes into Lisp or SQL values.

While it's not strictly necessary to serialize to universal times before saving to the database, it will make future queries easier.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>make-transaction</code> sets the default value of the<code>date</code> slot to<code>local-time:now</code>.</p>

<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="legs" class="almighty-section-title">Legs</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The real fun begins with legs. Legs are like entries in the accounting books: This account was debited this amount at this time. A Transaction has to have at least two Legs--a debit and a credit--to be balanced. The whole purposes of a double-entry accounting system is to record at least two sides of a transaction to reduce errors in money tracking. If a transaction doesn't balance, that's a sign that there is an error in money tracking.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">So first, let's setup our leg table.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(m:deftable leg ()
  ((account :col-type account)
   (side :col-type :integer)
   ;; Use LEG-ENTRY to access ENTRY-AMOUNT and ENTRY-CURRENCY as an
   ;; ALMIGHTY-MONEY:MONEY object.
   (entry-amount :col-type :integer)    ; ALMIGHTY-MONEY:MONEY object AMOUNT.
   (entry-currency :col-type :text) ; ALMIGHTY-MONEY:MONEY object CURRENCY-CODE.
   (transaction :col-type (or transaction :null)))

          (transaction (when (slot-boundp this 'transaction) (slot-value this 'transaction)))) 
      (format stream "~a ~[DEBIT~;CREDIT~] ~a" account side (leg-entry this)))))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Mito allows us to assign<code>:col-type</code> to other tables, creating a relationship between different tables. The SQL table will actually have<code>account_id</code> and<code>transaction_id</code> columns corresponding to the ids of the other table rows.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>side</code> records whether a leg is a debit or a credit. Debits will be represented with 0, and credits with 1. This makes the format string in<code>print-object</code> easier: we use<code>tilde brackets</code> <code>~[...;...~]</code> to do conditional printing. If the value of<code>slot</code> is 0, then the first string (zero-indexed) will be printed. If it's 1, then the string after the<code>~;</code> will be printed. You can do this with an arbitrary number of integer values.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(format nil "~[HELLO~;GOODBYE~;KONNICHIWA~;SAYONARA~]" 0)
                                        ; =&gt; "HELLO"

</code></pre>
</figure>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>entry-amount</code> and<code>entry-currency</code> will record the amount of a certain currency of the leg. Ideally, we would be able to define some kind of custom<code>:col-type</code> for an<code>almighty-money:money</code> object and name it<code>entry</code>, but mito doesn't provide the ability to create custom column types on the Lisp side, so we will simulate it by creating an "accessor" for entries:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If we look at<code>transact!</code> first, it can take an arbitrary number of legs. Since<code>legs</code> is a<code>&amp;rest</code> parameter, legs will be accessible in a list. First, we check to see if any of the arguments are a<code>local-time:timestamp</code>. If we find one, we will use that for the transaction.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">After that, we're going to ensure first that we have at least two legs. We also ensure that there is at least one debit and one credit in there. If the sides are all balanced, we add a<code>transaction</code> to the transaction slot of all the<code>legs</code> and save the transaction to the database.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">If the sides are unbalanced, we signal an<code>unbalanced-transaction</code> error. Creating and signaling a condition will make it easy to take specific actions for that kind of error (in a web application, we'd like to send the error to the user in the browser, for example).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">To begin with, we have<code>with-universals</code>. This converts<code>local-time:timestamp</code> objects into Common Lisp<code>universal times</code>. According to the HyperSpec (<a href="https://cl-community-spec.github.io/pages/Universal-Time.html">https://cl-community-spec.github.io/pages/Universal-Time.html</a>),</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Universal time is an absolute time represented as a single non-negative integer—the number of seconds since midnight, January 1, 1900 GMT (ignoring leap seconds).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Earlier, we wrote the<code>transaction</code> <code>deftable</code> in order to automatically serialize timestamps to universal times as well as the reverse. For our queries, if we ever want to filter rows by timestamps, we might be tempted to use<code>local-time:timestamp</code> objects directly, but they don't work. We could try converting timestamps into a format that SQLite understands that still looks like a timestamp, but for our purposes, a simple integer will do.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>with-db-connection</code> is a simple macro for running some code with a database connection.<code>mito:*connection*</code> needs to be set to a<code>dbi</code> connection, which we set to sqlite3.<code>unwind-protect</code> is a macro that will always run the form of its second argument even if the first argument form has some error. It's useful for any necessary cleanup after a form does some work, perhaps saving some data to a file, but then fails in the middle. In our case, we use it to close the connection.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>db-path</code> ensures that we have a place to put our database file (if the<code>data</code> folder isn't already created, for example).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>initialize-application-database</code> is for ensuring the<code>almighty-kaikei</code> tables are available and our Chart of Accounts is created. When we first start our application, we need to run this function.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It takes<code>bindings</code>, a list of lists (as in a<code>let</code> form) with a variable and the value to bind it to. It takes a string and converts it to a universal time. A simple but useful for reports like<code>general-ledger</code> that want to show data for a certain time range.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The<code>transaction-count</code> variable is bound to the result of a simple SQL query that gets the number of transactions for a time range.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>legs</code> is similar, with one small difference: it uses<code>mito:joins</code>--the equivalent of typing in<code>inner-join :table_name :on ...</code>. Since we're using<code>select-dao</code>, we can use the<code>joins</code> macro to save a little bit of typing.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">After that, we just go through the list of leg objects and<code>format</code> them. The<code>TILDE t</code> format directive here is useful for making tabular output.<code>~nt</code> is<i>padded</i> to the<code>nth</code> space.<code>~15t</code> means "If you aren't at column 15 yet, move there before continuing to format."</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Output of<code>general-ledger</code> should look like this:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Common Lisp can make executables. There are several ways to make executables. Which method you use will depend on the nature of your project.</p>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h3 id="tic-tac-toe" class="almighty-section-title">Tic-tac-toe</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Our tic-tac-toe game is the simplest example. We will use SBCL's<code>sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die</code> function.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die #P"path/to/the/binary"                    
                          :top-level "ttt:play-game-with-computer" 
                          :executable t)                          
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The first argument is the path to the binary you want to create.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The second argument is the package-qualified name of the "main" function you want to call when running the executable.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The third argument tells SBCL to return an executable, not a Lisp image.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">In order to call<code>sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die</code>, you of course need to have some code compiled and loaded; however, you can't run it in a Sly REPL. Instead, you need to run it in the command line. That would look like this:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-text">sbcl --load tic-tac-toe.lisp --eval "(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die #p\"ttt\" :toplevel #'ttt:play-game-with-computer :executable t)"
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">First, load the lisp file, then evaluate the call to<code>sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You can make the process more accessible to users by creating a Makefile to run the above:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-makefile">build:
	sbcl --load tic-tac-toe.lisp \
		 --eval "(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die #p\"ttt\" :toplevel #'ttt:play-game-with-computer :executable t)"
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">But, if you try to run this, you'll have a problem: the package<code>ttt</code> doesn't exist because we hadn't learned about packages before making the tic-tac-toe game. So let's go add a package definition to the tic-tac-toe.lisp file.</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(defpackage #:ttt
  (:use :cl)
  (:export #:play-game-with-computer))
(in-package #:ttt)
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">With that, you can run<code>make build</code>. Once the executable is created, you can type<code>./ttt</code> in your command line and enjoy a spirited game of tic-tac-toe against the computer.</p>

<h3 id="almighty-kaikei" class="almighty-section-title">almighty-kaikei</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">For very simple programs, the above is good enough. However, if your project has an<code>.asd</code> file, then you have the option of making an executable from a whole system.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The simple version of this process looks like this:</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Configure the system to build an executable.</p></li>

<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Run<code>asdf:make</code> on the loaded system.</p></li>

<h4 id="configure-system" class="almighty-section-title">Configure System</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">First, we need to configure the system. In our case, we want to load the<code>almighty-kaikei-examples</code> system, since it actually<i>uses</i> the library.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The first change is in the<code>:depends-on</code> list:<code>cl-dbi</code> will compile and load a driver for your database if you don't already have one loaded. From<a href="https://github.com/fukamachi/cl-dbi?tab=readme-ov-file#installation">the cl-dbi readme</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">cl-dbi will load another system on the fly depending on your database's driver:</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">:dbd-sqlite3
:dbd-mysql
:dbd-postgres</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You must reference the required one in your system definition if you plan to build an executable (and if you plan to run it on a machine where Quicklisp is not installed).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It will cause a nasty error in your executable if you don't add either the<code>:dbd-sqlite3</code>,<code>:dbd-mysql</code>, or<code>:dbd-postgres</code> systems to your system<code>:depends-on</code>. And don't forget to<code>vend get</code> when you add this system!</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h5 id="add-build-configuration" class="almighty-section-title">Add build configuration</h5>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Next, we add<code>:build-operation</code> with the argument<code>program-op</code>. ASDF has a number of<a href="https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/asdf.html#Predefined-operations-of-ASDF-1">predefined operations (https://asdf.common-lisp.dev/asdf.html#Predefined-operations-of-ASDF-1)</a> for compiling and loading systems. The default op is<code>load-op</code>. If you don't set it to<code>program-op</code>, you will simply load the system and get dropped into a REPL.<code>program-op</code> tells ASDF to make an executable out of the system.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>:build-pathname</code> is the name of the executable file we want to create.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>:entry-point</code> is the package-qualified name of the function we want to call when running the executable. More on this in just a second. For now, our system is all set up with a few changes.</p>

<h4 id="load-make-system" class="almighty-section-title">Load & Make System</h4>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Now we just need to load and make the system. We're going to do things a little differently this time, though. What we'll do is make a<code>build.lisp</code> file and simply load that file. This will give us more flexibility for orchestrating the next steps. First, the Makefile:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-makefile">kaikei: build.lisp almighty-kaikei-examples.asd main.lisp reports.lisp
	sbcl --load build.lisp 

</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The filenames after<code>kaikei:</code> tell make to run the code that follows if any of the files listed are updated.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">Now for the<code>build.lisp</code> file:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-lisp">(require :asdf)

;; Force ASDF to only look here for systems.
(asdf:initialize-source-registry `(:source-registry (:tree ,(uiop:getcwd)) :ignore-inherited-configuration))

(progn
  (format t "--- LOADING SYSTEM ---~%")
  (asdf:load-system :almighty-kaikei-examples)
  (format t "--- SYSTEM LOADED ---~%"))

(progn
  (asdf:make "almighty-kaikei-examples")
  (format t "--- DONE ---~%")
  (quit))
</code></pre>
</figure>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We<code>require</code> ASDF in order to use it here.<code>require</code> loads a package if it isn't already loaded. Usually ASDF is built into modern implementations of Common Lisp, but this ensures that ASDF is loaded in cases where your implementation doesn't load it (or have it built in).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The call to<code>asdf:initialize-source-registry</code> is to ensure that when ASDF loads the system that it resolves dependences using only the systems within our project directory.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>asdf:load-system</code> is the same operation performed with the REPL shortcut<code>, load-system</code>.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>asdf:make</code> runs the<code>:build-operation</code> we configured earlier.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We run<code>quit</code> because if for some reason you are running<code>make</code> and there are no changes, then no executable will be made and you'll be thrown into the REPL.<code>quit</code> is there to conveniently kick us out immediately.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The<code>.ros</code> file needs to have its own<code>main</code> function. For the purposes of deploying a web app, all you need to understand is this<code>main</code> function.

If the<code>DEBUGP</code> environment variable is set to<code>true</code>, then the<code>clack:clackup</code> <code>:debug</code> setting will be set to<code>t</code>, otherwise<code>nil</code>. Later we'll change the variables on the production environment, but this allows you to try this code out on your computer.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>sleep</code> is a function we haven't seen before. Usually, after loading the system and calling<code>clack:clackup</code> to start the server, it will remain on (usually you save it to a parameter so you can turn it off with<code>clack:stop</code>).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you run the executable built with this code, if you don't include the call to<code>(sleep most-positive-fixnum)</code>, systemd will assume your executable is done working and stop the service, turning off your server.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">It's time to upload your code to the server. If you are comfortable using git, you could use it now. For the sake of simplicity, we'll just upload with the<code>rsync</code> command.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">From your local machine, run this command:</p>
<figure class="almighty-code-block">
<pre><code class="almighty-src almighty-src-text">rsync -avz --progress ~/path/to/your/local/version/of/fuka-stack yourusername@domain-name-or-ip-address-to-your-server:/home/yourusername/fuka-stack

<h3 id="summary" class="almighty-section-title">Summary</h3>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">There are a number of things we could have done differently. We could have skipped Roswell and just used whatever version of SBCL was available on the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS package repository. We could have compiled the latest one from source. We could have built the executable in about three other ways. We could have used nginx instead of Caddy. We could have used<code>hunchentoot</code> instead of<code>clack</code> and friends. We could have used Docker to set up the entire environment on the server and simply run the code from that environment.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The principles to keep in mind when deploying a Common Lisp web app are these:</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You need to have some entry point--the call to start the server.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You need to run that call<i>someway</i> as a service to enable automatic restarts.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You will need to call<code>sleep</code> in the entry point to keep the server thread open in the background.</p></li>
<li><p class="almighty-book-paragraph">You want to turn off the debugger in prod.</p></li>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The script for building the executable is going to look similar to our previous<code>build.lisp</code> file. However, this one is a<code>.ros</code> file, used by Roswell to build the executable.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">The<code>.ros</code> file needs to have its own<code>main</code> function. For the purposes of deploying a web app, all you need to understand is this<code>main</code> function. That function uses<code>uiop:getenv</code> via<code>get-env</code> and<code>get-env-int</code> helpers to--you guessed it--get the environment variables<code>HOST</code> and<code>PORT</code>, defaulting to<code>127.0.01</code> and<code>5000</code>. If the<code>DEBUGP</code> environment variable is set to<code>true</code>, then the<code>clack:clackup</code> <code>:debug</code> setting will be set to<code>t</code>, otherwise<code>nil</code>. Later we'll change the variables on the production environment, but this allows you to try this code out on your computer.</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph"><code>sleep</code> is a function we haven't seen before. Usually, after loading the system and calling<code>clack:clackup</code> to start the server, it will remain on (usually you save it to a parameter so you can turn it off with<code>clack:stop</code>).</p>

<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">When you run the executable built with this code, if you don't include the call to<code>(sleep most-positive-fixnum)</code>, systemd will assume your executable is done working and stop the service, turning off your server.</p>

</article>
<article class="almighty-section">
<h5 id="service-env-files" class="almighty-section-title">Service & Env files</h5>
<p class="almighty-book-paragraph">We will need to run our executable as a service. If we don't, the server will block our terminal session, and if there is an error, it will simply crash the server. Systemd can be configured to restart any crashed services, and the service won't block our terminal session, either.</p>
